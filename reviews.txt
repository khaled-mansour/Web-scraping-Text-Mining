The market is especially traditional and most of the food stall menus were in German! I especially enjoyed the sausages (various kinds of wursts on offer here!), the waffles were delicious, fresh pretzels, and there's a special macaroni and cheese dish which was as fantastic as it was unpronounceable.\n\nThis isn't just a food market, as it's also the perfect place to buy unique presents; figurines, crystal, toys, jewellery, etc.. it's just that I'm a food oriented person! If you'd like an easy momento from the market, the mulled wine stall serves you in adorably designed mugs that you can actually keep for an extra £2 or so! \n\nI ended up visiting several times, and eagerly awaiting the return this November.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The Debenhams on Princes Street is too small to be of any real use to anyone, so if it's a big department store you need then it's defnitely worth a visit here.\n\nJust don't wear too many ayers when you do.

In our house growing up we had one Chinese we always ordered from, but we never actually went and had a meal there. This weekend however, we decided to change that.\n\nWalking into Loon Fung, the first thing I noticed was how busy it was. I guess this is kind of a given at the weekend, but it was clear the restaurant was popular. The second thing I noticed was the smell - I was starving and it smelled heavenly in there. Unfortunately, we arrived a good twenty five minutes early and our table wasn't ready yet, so we headed to the pub next door for a quick drink.  When we returned, we were quickly seated at our table, given menus, and had drinks orders taken. I should point out, if you're worried about spending too much on booze, Loon Fung is a cheap option with decent bottles of wine priced at around £16.75. A down side to Loon Fung is that its size is a little on the small side for its popularity and the tables are all rather close together so you might feel a little cramped, but the staff are friendly and happy to explain any dishes to you.\n\nWe started perusing the menu and the gruelling task of getting four people to agree on what dishes to order began. In the end I think we went a little overboard, ordering three dim sums to start, five mains and two portions of egg fried rice.\n\nOur Dim Sum included Roast Pork Buns, Shiu Mai (pork & prawn) and Har Kow (prawn). The pork buns were quite large and for that reason, only two. There being four of us and me not being a fan of seafood, I got one big one all to myself and I was so happy I did! The dough was soft and perfectly steamed and the meat inside was tender and full of flavour - most likely char siu style. My only criticism would be that the filling to dough ratio was a bit off, there needed to be a bit more pork and a little less bun as the dough is quite thick.\n\nI also had a taste of the pork and prawn Shiu Mai dumplings because I was so darn hungry and I figured well, it's only half prawn! The pastry was lovely and silky smooth and the filling tasty, although there was definitely a distinct prawn flavour but it worked well with the pork.\n\nOur starters were taken away, hot plates put on the table, and we were brought our fried rice for the mains, which were placed in the small bowls we had already been given. Yes, one small Chinese bowl and spoon and a set of chop sticks, that's what you eat your food with here. There's no cutlery unless you ask for it so we all decided to soldier on.\n\nOur mains were Shredded Beef, Sliced Pork in Barbecue Sauce, Cha Cha Chicken, Salty King Prawns and Chilli, and Singapore Noodles. We had originally ordered Char Siu pork but the staff recommended the dish we ended up with, describing it as more of a hoisin style sauce and it was by far my favourite. It had strong Asian flavours, tender pieces of pork drenched in a sticky, sweet and salty sauce.\n\nAnother favourite was the Shredded Beef. One of the down sides to ordering this dish from the take away is that by the time it gets to you, the beef is no longer crispy. The dish in front of us however, was exactly the way it should be. Super crisp strips of beef in a sweet chilli sauce with sliced carrot, onions and other veg.\n\nThe Cha Cha Chicken, which was described as being served in a mild, sizzling ginger sauce, was rather bland. As my mum so eloquently put it, it looked \"rather anaemic.\" There was very little colour to it and next to the other dishes it just sort of paled. On tasting the flavour was nice and the vegetables were crunchy, it just didn't excite me. Personally, I wanted to go for their Special Lemon Chicken - a dish they are known for - but in all honesty, we didn't really need it, we already had so much food.\n\nI can't comment on the prawns because I don't eat them, I'm told they were tasty but had gone a little soggy. The noodles were great - a lovely taste from sesame oil, soy sauce, lots of vegetables and varying meats. By the end of the meal we were all stuffed and there was very little left on the table. What we were all surprised by was the bill. For four people, two bottles of wine, two beers, three starters, five mains, two sides and a tip, the bill came to £108. This, in my opinion, is very reasonable and great value for money because the quality of the food is high and the service was good.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

My sister will tell you that it's the best Chinese in Edinburgh: I don't rate it quite so highly. I always go for the shredded chilli beef and this is a dish that they have down to a tee: succulent pieces of beef, fried until it's nice and crispy then coated in a fiery chilli sauce, mmm mmm mmm.

We always over order but I never learn to recognise my own limits. When you a stitch from eating too much food that's when you know you're enjoying yourself!\n\nSalt and Chilli Chicken wings are my favorite starter although the King Prawn version is also pretty good. Make sure you get some Chinese tea to help you pace your drinking and cleanse your body (am I kidding myself by thinking this minus' calories?). Crispy duck is a must for mains but it's also worth getting a noodle dish too. \n\nIf I had one warning I would say that the Loon Fung is the kind of place where you need to get to know the menu. A few of the dishes can be a bit too sweet or greasy and some the descriptions are a little misleading. Nonetheless this is still one of my favourite restaurants. I'm really sad that I can't remember the name of the lovely woman who owns the Loon Fung but you'll be sure to know who I mean when you see her warm smile. If there is even the smallest mouthful still left in your bowl she'll offer to wrap it up in a doggie bag for you to take home as she really hates to see food go to waste.

We also had the sweet and sour pork which was fine, lots of pineapple chunks which my toddler son always loves to eat. The staff were friendly and helpful.

That was good enough for me.\nWhen we sat down my sister and brother-in-law and I compared our must haves: i need extra vegetables, they needed the aromatic crispy duck with pancakes (Peking duck) and hot and sour soup, we agreed on fried rice and bean curd and black bean sauce. It was all so good. The duck especially was a much larger serving than I am used to and we could make our own pancakes. The fried rice tasted just like home.\nAs dinner wore on and we worked our way through the large amount of food the dining room slowly filled up. When we had arrived there was only one other table but when we left it was full. Before leaving however we ordered the toffee banana and lemon sorbet, served in a frozen hollowed out lemon.

The Omni Centre is the Scottish version of this, so take out the bowling and laser quest and replace it with more alcohol and fast food places. \n\nIt's a good place for a Saturday night if you don't fancy going out. They have a Pizza Hut, a Frankie & Benny's, a Slug and Lettuce, and a Chinese Buffet place for all your food needs. If you fancy having a cheeky tipple then there is a Lloyds and a Walkabout (which is a bit scummy, despite the no Trackie B's rule) which are quite well priced. \n\nThe main reason you'd go there is for the Vue cinema. Although it has quite a few screens, it is relatively expensive, with full price tickets being about £7 and for 3D films about £9.50. They have all the new releases and they also sell popcorn \/ hotdogs \/ pick n mix etc.\n\nThe Omni Centre is a good addition to central Edinburgh activities, but if you're looking to go to the cinema then for the prices Fountain Park is better.

There are a collection of restaurants that no one really wants to eat in. The gym attached is underground, and whilst I\"ve tried the gym once on a free pass, I really didn't enjoy it as it was just one, big underground room. There's also a cinema, which doesn't really *feel* like a cinema. You have to go up some escalators, it's all open plan and big windows. I can't quite articulate it, but I'm not even a fan of the cinema itself (yeah the screens and movies shown are just as good as any other cinema, but I don't take pleasure coming here, buying popcorn and ice cream, and gathering in a wee group.)\n\nSo, it's a really big, modern, all-glass building that contains a basement gym, a second-level cinema, and lots of greasy, uninspiring restaurants that I have no desire to go to. The Omni has so much potential and I just don't like anything about it.\n\nAs Emily also mentions, the restaurants try to have the 'outdoor patio' effect, which can neve be achieved in Scotland really due to weather, so having it inside the Omni instead should work well. It should. But it just feels like a big, empty hall that has no vibe, energy, or buzz and I think dining here (whether inside the restaurant, or out on the patio) would be a sad affair.\n\nJeez that's a negative review. There's nothing wrong with the building itself. I quite like the very, very large pictures of rugby players they put on the outside for a while. I just feel it has so much potential, but is so very lacking in any quality substance.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have to admit I'm somewhat taken by the \"pavement dining\" experience that the restaurants go for in here.  In a country where outdoor dining can take place for approximately 2 weeks out of the year, it's a cute\/fun concept to have patios outside the restaurants in this indoor space.  \n\nThe issue of course is the businesses themselves.  We've got a Whetherspoons (class personified), a Slug and Lettuce (only a notch higher than W'spoons), La Tasca (chain tapas), apparently also a Filling Station, Frankie and Bennies, and Pizza Hut.  So, not exactly the place to come for a culinary journey.  \n\nAfter filling up on slow fast food, you can then choose to see a film at the Vue (where the best seats will break the bank) or go for a workout at the Virgin gym.  I hear it's a really nice facility, but couldn't see myself joining a gym somewhere surrounded by poor quality food joints and a movie theatre.\n\nSo, the Omni tries but these days I only come here for a movie, and that's *only* if I really have to.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Ivory and Willow, in Costorphine, is one of these.  I have yet to see any other shop that combines a cafe with an upmarket gift shop.  It's definitely worth a look, which is just what I did.\n\nThe inside of the store is chic and sophisticated, befitting the clientèle that this place would be aiming for.  Prices are not cheap, but then you wouldn't expect them to be.  Most of the items they sell are the sort of things that you wouldn't need, but would end up buying anyway.  I perused their small section of greetings cards, and was reasonably impressed with what I saw.\n\nThe other side to this place is the cafe.  I didn't get anything, due to a lack of money at the time, but I was able to have a good poke around.  Apart from the normal coffee shop items that you'd find nearly everywhere, there was a visually appealing selection of small cakes and muffins, and a few shelves stocked with posh-looking biscuits, jams and other preserves.  All of these looked very tasty.\n\nIvory and Willow has succeeded in finding a niche in this part of town, and I expect it will get a fair amount of business.  Definitely worth a look if you're just window shopping, or looking to purchase that valuable one off gift.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The shiny objects of the window displays of Willow and Ivory caught my eye.  Then I noticed that the shop also consisted of a coffee house, and through the door I went.  \n\nSeeing as the coffee house is intercalated within a upmarket, ornate interior shop, the interior certainly doesn't disappoint. In the centre is an elegantly petite chandelier  that's effect is enhanced by the large selection of mirrors hanging on the walls, all with ornate, golden frames.  This, along with the floral paintings also hanging from the walls, provides a well executed contrast with the dark seating.  The seating varies from chocolate sofas to lighter, beech chairs and tables. The tables and chairs are very well orientated providing the place with an open feel. \n\nThe foodstuffs available stretch far beyond what I'd expect from an average coffee shop. A range of herbal teas, smoothies, ice creams and delicious looking homebakes are available.  The hot drinks come in three sizes which are clearly presented just behind the counter so you know exactly what you are getting. I ordered a regular Mocha which was of just the right sweetness, although at £2.95 for a regular was a little on the pricey side.  Looking on the menu on the table, I found excellent meal deals for all ages, including a cheeseburger and an ice cream milkshake for £4.95 and a variety of options for children's meals. \n\nAs for the store itself, it is like walking into luxury.  It was very pleasant to have a quick browse and look at the ornate tables, chairs, beds, bowls, mirror and artwork available to buy. However, this is quite upmarket and so if your looking for Ikea value, this is not the place to go. \n\nOverall, the blend of coffee house and interior shop is very well crafted and makes this place certainly worth a visit if you happen to be in the Corstorphine area.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It retails at just under £60 and at the moment if you buy it you get a free sampler kit with various different flavours to add to it - sounds awesome!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I can not recommend him enough. If I hadn't been a graduate student at the time, I would have been coming on a weekly basis to help restore my very sore shoulder and neck pain.\n\nPeter is extremely knowledgeable about the body, how different musculatures are connected to each other and affect each other. He himself is no stranger to pain and completely understands what it's like to feel restricted by it. His lovely demeanour, is relaxing, respectful, and inquisitive about what your needs are, where the pain is, what your expectations are and he is very good about informing you about what sorts of progress you can expect to see from working with him. The massage itself can be painful as he has to put pressure on knots and areas of buildup, but I personally found this to be an enormous relief. \n\nHe has a way of feeling where the pain is and usually finds the spots of pain and tightness by the feel of them alone, not just from what you tell him. His massage is the only one that I've ever had in my life that has actually relieved pain and tension. I believe that the massage helped break up scar tissue and relax some of the muscles and knots to the point where I could start practicing better posture again instead of being crippled into the same particular dysfunctional position. Peter is also just a great guy!   Lovely to chat to, compassionate, and interesting. I always looked forward to my massages and I hope to find someone as good in my new home. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.petermordaunt.co.uk\/?page_id=58","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

However I always put it off, telling myself it would go away, until one day it go so bad, and I was so sick of it, I decided to do something about it. After being turned away by several doctors, telling me it was just postural and there wasn't much I could do, I eventually decided to seek help elsewhere.\n\nI'm glad I did. I have been going to the Edinburgh Physiotherapy Centre since.  I have since leaned a a lot about my problem and my treatment there has done wonders. Having had both their sports massage and physiotherapy services I have had some experience of this excellent medical centre that offers a range of services aimed at sorting out your physical shape.\n\nThe centre has physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors made up from a very professional team. They are particularly good at not only poking and prodding out but also telling you what is going on and what they think is wrong with you, making extra recommendations and giving advice whenever possible. The centre can also give alternative treatment such as acupuncture, again carried out with utmost profession (I can speak from experience).\n\nIn an ideal world, prices would be a touch a cheaper, but compared to other physio in Edinburgh it remains competitive. The receptionist staff are always really friendly and we have a good chat. \n\nIf you are having back, or any other chronic pain, I highly recommend getting it sorted before it drags on. The Edinburgh Physiotherapy Centre is a good start.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I booked a same day massage appointment due to some horrible issues with a tight hip I was desperate to fix. \n\nUpon taking my call, the receptionist was really friendly and helpful booking an appointment. I also learned they have a Glasgow office too (for my Glaswegian friends). \n\nSo to the massage. I was warned this would be deep tissue and pretty full on so I thought I was mentally prepared. Boy, was I wrong. This was probably one of the most painful deep tissue massages I've ever had- but in saying that, my therapist knew exactly what areas to target and paid specific focus to this. \n\nSo this went on for an hour, me trying not to swear, lash out, or cry. If you're looking for ambiance and relaxation this place isn't it. They're out to fix the body and do a damn good job of it, even though you might hate them at the time of the massage. \n\nThe massage room itself was clinical, minimal, and I was treated to Polish music for the duration of my massage. \n\nAt the completion of the massage I was warned of bruising. Still, this did not prepare me. Never in my life have I had such severe bruising from massage. I actually panicked as the bruising set in within a few hours where my hip\/ lower back area just turned a hideous reddish purple that covers my entire lower back and hip. Mind you, I instantly felt relief in my hip joint, though I think it'll need a few more sessions to really sort it out. \n\nThis place is full on. My massage therapists ability to know where to focus and make some headway with my complaints was impressive.

I like the coffee here but find it nothing special. The one time I went in for food was during a particularly horrendous week during my thesis writing and I entered with a 'I'm worth a £9 salad darnit'. The salad was goats cheese, pear and beetroot and I enjoyed it - though could have made it myself in less time it took them to scoop it from the display bowls- but found the close tables (upstairs) meant my reading was constantly interrupted by the dramatic conversation at the table next to me. \n\nRecently, I went with a group of Yelpers as part of the Hot chocolate quest. As organiser I had unfortunately been organising getting a job and so was lax on the 'reserving a table' end of things. I went in a good bit early to say that I hadn't booked but that about 5 friends would be arriving soon and if they could accommodate us it would be great. Cold would be the word I would use to describe the reaction. \n\nWe were put downstairs and when a larger table opened up upstairs we were given the option to move. By that stage it turned out that I had underestimated the numbers (RSVP people!!) and there was now a few more people than anticipated but we fit quite nicely into the table offered.\n\nThe hot chocolate itself was enjoyable. I don't go in much for sweet things and this hot chocolate was nicely toned down, though to such an extent I couldn't taste any of the juniper, pine or smokey saltiness I should have. Moreover, the sprinkling on top of orange chocolate, which looked great, incorrectly convinced me I had in fact received the tangerine hot chocolate.\n\nI then had a cheese scone (to neutralise the sweetness) and it was nice but very bready. I couldn't finish it.\n\nOverall I like the bright airiness of Urban angel. They definitely cater to a particular Edinburgh demographic - which demographic can be inferred from the location of the two cafes and the range of fancy moustaches you'll see on a visit - but it's not me. I might return to try some breakfast food, so we may knock this up a notch sometime soon.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have also only been once, and only had the hot chocolate (I had to rush off or I'd have had a slice of the pretty tasty looking cakes on display). So, perhaps take my review with a pinch of (smoked) salt...\n\nI popped by at the weekend with a group of other Yelpers, in our quest to find the best hot chocolate in Edinburgh. I so wanted Urban Angel's offering to be up there, but it's actually my least favourite so far. The hot chocolate is by Edward & Irwyn, based in Morningside, and, I am assured by Cressi F, delicious in solid form. But in hot form, it was so, so disappointing.\n\nFor one thing it was £3.60 for a pretty small glass of hot chocolate! This is on par with everything else in Urban Angel, and I'll be honest and say that the high prices are the reason I've never been before (and don't intend to revisit, I mean, £8.90 for French toast, are you kidding me?!). It also wasn't that hot. And despite ordering the 'Scots Pine, Juniper and Smoked Sea Salt' hot chocolate, it tasted of nothing (not even strongly of chocolate), and what little discernible taste there was, was disguised by the sprinkling of orange chocolate on top.\n\nSo, no. I won't be back. It seems very nice inside, as I said, but the prices are waaaay too high for me to consider returning and I definitely wasn't wowed into believing that the prices were justified either.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Once after bumbling around the area wondering where to sit down for a quick drink and secondly, after not getting in to eat where I'd wanted to. The first time we just had a round of coffees when I had family visiting. It was OK. Average kind of cappuccino but was disappointed by the extremely slow service. My other half got very twitchy about the dawdling and irately labelled it a 'pretentious place' and proclaimed he wouldn't be going back. He still sneers at it when we wander past. I wasn't quite so offended, the look of the delightful cakes on the counter made me think it couldn't be all bad.\n\n\n My next visit was on a week day evening with a fussy friend with a plethora of food allergies. We couldn't get in our first place of choice so after glancing at the menu, this one was the most allergy-friendly to her in the Broughton Street area. On sitting down in the snug interior and looking at the wine list, she particularly liked how the wine was labelled to whether it was vegan or not. I thought this was pretty good too, as it's always preferable not to be quaffing my alcohol laced with bull's blood or pig's hooves if there's a choice!\n\n\n We had some hummus and bread to start, which was pretty good. For my main course I had a smoked haddock risotto from the specials board. It was quite tasty, but not overwhelmingly so. I ate it thinking I could cook up something better myself as it didn't have much depth of flavour. My friend went a bit mental with salt over her dinner as she thought hers was a little bland. It really wasn't a bad meal and we enjoyed our evening there, it's just that it wasn't a wow kind of meal. I wouldn't rush to go back. The plus was that the service was definitely a lot swifter this time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Everything here is freshly made and mostly grouped in the organic category, and the amazing display of cakes at the front counter is always my downfall on the way out.

I was told that a table would be ready within five to ten minutes. After twenty, I decided I would order to take-away. I opted for the 'superfood salad'. When I opened it, it consisted of some rocket lettuce, two cherry tomatoes, and a couple slices of red and yellow pepper. There was no sign of the advertised avocado, fennel, apple, hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, goji berries or tahini dressing. For £8.50, my wallet certainly felt at least a fiver lighter than it should have.\n\nSecond time I visited was at the insistence of my lunch companion. It was much more pleasant than my first experience. It was quieter this time and we had no trouble being seated. I went for the mackerel with a roast butternut mix as a side. It was perfectly cooked and thoroughly enjoyable. My faith was renewed.\n\nUnfortunately, third time was no charm. Again, it was fairly quiet and I decided to attempt the 'superfood salad' again (Still wanting my tasty avocado, seed and tahini flavour hit) Again; the avocado and seed combination was conspicuous by its absence. Not a trace of either. However, this time, I was served a plate of rocket. There were more leaves on my plate than Kew Gardens must see in Autumn. A huge amount of overpowering fennel and apple but nothing else. Not even a tomato or slice of pepper. To be served that and charged £9 for the privilege is just insulting.\n\nThe waiting staff were great, I have no complaints about service but there is obviously a weak link in the kitchen here. If you are relying on suppliers for produce, alter the menu accordingly (even then, there's a Real Foods just yards away!) There's no lack of excellent cafes and delis doing what Urban Angel attempt and doing it a lot better, without charging prices that simply do not befit the food, either.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The area is a haven for wildlife and dog walkers. It really is a fantastic slice of the countryside hidden in Edinburgh. I am alwasy amazed at the ammount of people I take for a weekend wander up here that have never heard of it. You walk along the banks of a fast moving stream meadering through bridges and trees eventually the path opens up in places and you are greeted by a very dapper looking town house. Across from the house up a small slope is the victorian outside freezer built into the rock face. Eventually you find yourself a few minutes walk from the bottom of morninside. I love this place and would happily be wandering around this area every weekend.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

After one of the finest pints of Best courtesy of the Jolly Judge we meandered down to the living room with a pocket full of £20s and bags of charm, ready for a night on the sarge. On arrival we were greeted by an extremely attractive barman of Italian origin and a rather charming chap whose red hair hinted at his Neanderthal heritage. Offered an abysmal selection of real ales both me and my long fingered friend opted for a pint of the black stuff. While we watched the charming Neanderthal show of his skills on the coffee machine we couldn't help but notice that at least 3 in every 5 coffee made was sent back. We enquired about the coffee and were assured that the Neanderthal was indeed one of Australia's finest baristas and the reason so many coffees were being sent back was the undeveloped palate of the British coffee consumer. Our mind at rest we ordered another pint of the black stuff and the extremely attractive barman of Italian descent insisted that we have a Jaeger on the house, it was, as he asserted, getting late. so after a couple more drinks we staggered out of TLR at 17:02 completely wasted. The bags of charm we were carrying soaked through with Jaeger and any notion that we might successfully kiss close completely thwarted. All in all a bloody good evening and one that wasn't ruined, as may nights are, by the compulsion to stay out for more than enough time than is necessary to get completely horse drunk on Jaeger. After all that's what life is about! 10 out of 10 for TLR","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Between my friend and I, it cost us around £35 for nibbles, two starters, a side, a dessert platter and a rum and coke. This probably sounds like quite a lot. But was it worth it?\nThe food was delicious. We ordered garlic and herb bread with West Country cheddar. The bread was crusty and the cheese was full of flavour. My starter, tiger prawns with roasted red peppers in chilli and garlic was beautiful. The peppers were roasted to the perfect point. The chilli sauce was pretty spicy but tasty. As a side we had some potato gratin which was surprisingly the best part of the meal but ridiculously more-ish and so I felt cheated by the small size of the serving. To finish our meal, we ordered a sharing board of desserts. I think this was the part of the night where I died and went to heaven. We started off with our rhubarb compote and blackberries with a sabayon cream. I don't have a scooby about sabayon cream but I can say that the little serving was warm and homely and satisfied my penchant for rhubarb. We then moved on to our chocolate brownies, eton mess, strawberries and chocolate fondue. The brownies were very rich so I was glad I had the eton mess and a raspberry compote to balance the flavour. However, nothing quite beats the sugar rush of when you pour the chocolate fondue on top of the brownie. It's also particularly excellent when, given the excessive amount of chocolate fondue, you and your dining partner decide that it would be fitting to start drinking the fondue like chocolate shots. This is the moment when you bring down the class of the establishment because you are both a pair of sugar junkies.\nI really enjoyed this meal but that was probably because I wasn't immensely hungry. I believe that if I went in there with a considerable appetite I would either be disappointed or out of pocket. You are paying for quality rather than quantity. Someone might argue that we weren't cheated and that our portions were small because we ordered starters. I beg to differ as I saw some main courses being delivered to tables and they could definitely provide more on your plate for what you are paying.\nThe atmosphere was rather nice  very chilled out and laid back but classy at the same time. Our waitress was nice enough but we did feel neglected towards the end of our meal when we asked for our bill. It took at least 15 minutes for our bill to be delivered and that was after I hunted down another server to let them know we had been waiting. I understand she was probably run off her feet but we may have been in a hurry to get away, which fortunately we were not.\nI'd quite like to go here for a drink some time. The cocktails are meant to be very nice. Moreover, I definitely approved of the entertainment. All throughout the night I could hear music which sounded like jazz and easy listening versions of 'Town called Malice' and 'You've got a friend in me.' I assumed it was a covers album by some musician like Jamie Callum. However, it was a pleasant surprise as we were leaving the place to discover there was a man playing a grand piano next to entrance and he was the one who had been singing all night long. And to make matters better, he was quite easy on the eye!\nSo how would I rate my experience? Tasty food and worthwhile if you're willing to splash out more than you probably should. The only way this place could get 5 stars off of me is if they provided a little more in their portion sizes and their waiting service was slicker.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Having read previous Yelp reviews it appeared to be hit or miss. And by its location alone I was apprehensive that 'substance' may be overlooked for 'style' (don't judge, we all make pre-informed decisions like these.)\n\nUpon entering I was quite pleased with what a chilled out but stylish place it was. I've been here before for drinks in the evening, and the place makes the transition from lunch time spot to evening drinks quite well. There's also a whole restaurant section out the back which keeps the majority of dining away from the drinking.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive and creative for a stylish bar. I opted for the scallop and chorizo starter, with a side of balsamic vegetables and my friend the beef and ginger salad. Despite that it was a starter, three of the largest, juiciest scallops I've seen emerged, with proper big chunks of chorizo. Again, I was slightly sceptically expecting some lifeless, generic uninspired dish but I was impressed!\n\nAnd it was delicious. The veg especially (although a little oily). And one of my scallops was slightly, slightly less cooked inside. But it was ok. The salad looked great too.\n\nThe staff were attentive and friendly. The food was delicious, although not cheap for a mid-week lunch. It's perhaps a perfect spot for ladies who lunch mid-week or a nice lazy weekend brunch, lunch and booze spot.\n\nPatchy reviews and experience are a shame, as it was quite a delightful wee lunch that I had here.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

We were so wrapped up in a conversation and he was so quick that we didn't manage to catch him but flagged him up and informed him that we had about 1\/4 of a bottle left.  He actually argued with us, saying that he up-ended the bottle and there was certainly nothing left in it.  It was the oddest experience,  We finally argued our way into getting some replacement wine, but nowhere along the line did anyone apologise to us.  \n\nThe whole thing was quite bizarre and though I wouldn't colour the whole bar on that one experience, I would say that if you are drinking wine in a group keep an eye out that they don't snag your bottle!","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It was only 5 of us that went ahead and ordered the Roast in the end but there was enough for all!\n\nAnd what a Roast it was. Chicken, with gravy, potatoes, brocolli, carrots, and a yorkshire pudding. The broccoli was actually delicious as it had been cooked in garlic, as had the chicken. There were also two full breasts on my plate. So much chicken, for £8.95!\n\nI then had the Whisky Cranachan for dessert and it was nice. The crumble looked delicious, as did the Elbow Mess. \n\nAll in all, everyone around the table was very satisfied with the Sunday Roast or Sunday lunch of some sort. Not a scrap of burger was left on the plates, or chorizo and prawn salad; and the chips were cooked in duck fat! (also all gone).\n\nI caught a peek at the menu, and they had a pretty tasty looking brunch menu too, as well as a tempting \"catch of the day served with duck fat chips\".\n\nThe waitress seemed a little put out that we were there, I can't tell why (perhaps that we didn't all order roast?) although she had been lovely on the phone when I booked. I will be back, and I do hope we hadnt put it her off kilter in someway. We were just a hungry bunch of folk looking for a friendly Sunday Roast together. I'd highly recommend it for a great value, good feed!","useful":7,"funny":1,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

Specifically, I wanted a cocktail.  Treacle was rammed, so we continued down the road but deeper in to pub land where ordering anything other than beer makes you an arsehole.  But then, The Man had an epiphany and said \"What about that Elbow place!\"\nWe'd been meaning to check this place out since it opened, and it seemed like the perfect opportunity.\n\nWhen we walked in, I got more of a pub-ey vibe and didn't see a cocktail list anywhere, so I opted for a Jack and coke.  But then I saw a board which displayed the \"cocktail of the month\" and said \"I want that!\"\n\nThe bartender was lovely and had a bit of craic with us while he made my cocktail.  \n\nThe drink was nice though I'll admit I wasn't incredibly impressed.  I like to taste the tang of alcohol in my drinks and this just tasted like juice.  Nice juice, but juice nonetheless.\n\nThere was just something about this place which didn't feel quite right, it didn't seem to fit into any boxes.  The Man said it's not the kind of place you would come with a bloke for a beer, and I don't feel like it's the kind of place I would come with a girlfriend for girly drinks because of the location and the unusual atmosphere.\n\nThe decor is a bit interesting - kind of 70s trash meets space chic, it's a little weird.  The light fittings are pretty cool, though.  It also has a disco ball and old movies with subtitles playing on mute.  \n\nIt's definitely not a bad place to come, but something just didn't seem to feel right or quite comfortable.  It might just not be my scene, but I prefer places with a bit more life in them and a bit less disco ball.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Peopled with cheery staff, furnished with smooth conker-red leather benches and containing a shelf laden with teetering piles of board games, Elbow is the kind of place I'd like to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon after a long walk. There's even an old 2-player arcade game set into a coffee table and surrounded by beanbags. Hooray!\n\nWe arrived for dinner at around six and were instantly greeted by a perky chap who took our drinks orders and supplied us, somewhat apologetically, with a menu scribbled out on a piece of A4. That might sound a bit rubbish, but the reason was that they were just in the process of switching to the winter menu, so actually we had the excited feeling of previewing something new.\n\nI started with the soup of the day - broccoli and cauliflower - which came served in a wonderful tubby pot with a lid to keep it hot and steaming. The bread that came with it (and - hallelujah! - sufficient butter!) was perfection: great hefty chunks toasted to a list crisp on the outside but still warm and fluffy within. The soup was perfect. I normally end up chucking tons of extra salt into things but this was spot on.\n\nNext up was the \"catch of the day\" with chips fried in duck fat. We never did get round to asking what kind of fish it was, but it was slightly pungent, meaty in texture and - as we had been warned - enormous! It could have benefitted from a bit of lemon juice but it was otherwise really good. The chips were super-chunky and very solid, so I was totally full by about two thirds of the way through! I'm starting to think I'm losing my touch...\n\nThe music was slightly louder than I might have liked, and I'm not a fan of televisions in pubs either, but I'm not going to complain too much when for both courses (and the soup could have been a main on its own!) and two lime and sodas, it only cost me £14.45. Overall, it's a cosy and comfortable little spot with good hefty meals I'd happily go back to.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This is probably one of the quirkiest hotels I have ever stayed in and I loved it.  This is in a great location in Edinburgh, close to everything Old Town.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The rooms are clean and well stocked with lush amenities.  We didn't take advantage of their running club or parkour workout but I imagine that's fun too (though I can't imagine running in Edinburgh with all its hills, my calves ache just thinking about it).  Overall, me and the S.O. loved this place.  Two things though: 1) The entrance to the hotel is in the courtyard of a pub (The Three Sisters) and that was a bit confusing....mainly because we arrived during the Wimbledon finals and the courtyard was packed and I felt really silly lugging bags through what is essentially a crowded bar.  The noise at night isn't nearly as bad as you think it's going to be being so close to a busy pub.  2) The shower floors are slippery.  I slipped once or twice and the glass divider is flimsy.  I pictured myself careening through it and slicing myself to shreds every time I showered (Mind you, I have an active imagination) but I saw where it had been ripped out of the ceiling before so I think its happened in the past.  Maybe some texture to the shower floor would be nice (and safe).  All in all, those two things only get a half star knocked off...can't recommend enough.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This hotel is amazing.  Starting with the front desk staff, my experience was excellent.  We were welcomed with friendly staff who were genuinely happy to help us with anything we needed.  We received a room across the courtyard and up a set of stairs.  It was our own private oasis!  There are only two rooms on that side of the building, accessed only by a key card to get into the hallway, and then a physical key to get into the room.  The room was huge with 4 beds, a desk, a wardrobe, and a good size bathroom.  The room had hardwood floors which made me confident that the floors were clean.  There was tea and water inside the room for no additional cost, and delicious chocolate cakes too!  There is free wifi and the signal was great.\n\nThe hotel offers breakfast also - continental or cooked to order.  The Three Sisters bar was so fun.  I was a bit curious about the noise factor since our room was next to the courtyard but we never heard any noise at all coming from the bar area which was a very positive thing.\n\nThe hotel is central to just about everything - the Royal Mile, and about half-way between Edinburgh Castle & the Palace.  Around the corner and down another street, you will find Greyfriar Bobby's - the famous pub.  Everything is within walking distance which was great.\n\nThe front desk staff were very helpful during our stay and made several great recommendations for our 3 days there.  The only negative was that there was no elevator to get to our room, however the positives definitely outweigh the negative in this case.  I would definitely return here in the future.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Gotta love a two star jump!\n\nI found myself in this area today and near famished... apparently, walking 30 minutes turns me into a food zombie. There are a few usual suspects on Leith Walk that I would usually stop into but I needed 1. wifi 2. a place to kill an hour and a half between meetings and 3. somewhere borderline healthy, as I knew in my hangry state that I was likely to over eat and get sleepy (I'm basically a giant toddler you guys...). I remembered having stopped here for coffee and as it was right around the corner from my next meeting, made my way here.\n\nThis time around, I skipped the coffee completely, having been underwhelmed the first time. Instead I got a sparkling water alongside a greek salad and pita & hummus... and with that little meal, found my new go-to spot on the walk. The salad was a great size with PROPER feta and big chunks of fresh veggies. I love the fact that they serve it with olive oil and balsamic on the side, so you can choose to dress it to your taste - so many greek salads go overboard with dressing and it ruins it. I could have eaten an entire plate of the grilled bread that comes on the side as well. The pita and hummus was the perfect add on though the portion of hummus is way to big to eat solo (think of being served a store bought tub size of hummus in one sitting...). Finished things off with a cup of tea while I plunked away on my computer. It was quick, cheap(ish), friendly and both healthy but totally satisfying. The free wifi is a nice perk and the place wasn't busy, so it was a good place to get some work done. It's not fancy or anything out of the ordinary, but it's a great lunch spot and I'm a total fan.\n\nTip: bring cash if you can as they charge extra to use debit\/credit.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

The main reason I'm adding that caveat is because Amalia replied to our wedding enquiry and we met with her to discuss what we were looking for but were then transferred to Eileen, who was in charge of wedding arrangements. \n\nAmalia and Eileen were both brilliant, and the flowers we received for the wedding were not only ideal for what we were looking for (my fiancee even came on the first appointment with Amalia!) but we received many compliments on our flowers from some very discerning guests. We gave local guests permission to nick the gorgeous centerpieces for their flats ;-P\n\nThere were a few blips in communication between dealing with Amalia and Eileen. Upon the first appointment with Amalia I freely admitted I didn't know a huge amount about flowers and was aware most flowers at Narcissus were locally and regionally sourced. This sat very well with us because we wanted the wedding to be a celebration of the best of Scotland and we didn't want the waste associated with excessive imports. \n\nSo we got a pretty good idea of what to expect after the consultation with Amalia, then after it was transferred to Eileen things got a bit muddled along the way. Had to make a few small tweaks with quantities and what we were looking for to have flowers, but it was ironed out very quickly. \n\nI had a good idea overall of what we were looking for and Eileen was very responsive, helpful and communicative. For example: ideally I would've like camellias for my hair flowers but Eileen tried her best and let me know well ahead that gardenias would likely be available instead if the hard to source camellias weren't available . She is clearly very knowledgable at reading clients and their wishes and works with top vendors.\n\nIt would've made the process more seamless if we would've dealt with the same person from the start, especially considering our initial email to them was about wedding flowers. \n\nBut it ended up being a small blip. The centerpieces, gent's buttonholes, bouquet and grand upstairs arrangements blew us and everyone away. \n\nI'll post more flowers once I get the photos back to convey a full idea of their high level of artistry.\n\nWe chose Narcissus because we were told they were one of the absolute best and we were so happy with their work!

Consequently, for seven straight weeks, twice a week, I made the pleasant, brisk walk from Haymarket to Morningside Road. And back again in the evening. That's 24 times I walked along Dalry Road and 24 times I passed First Coast. It's bright blue and white sign had certainly caught my eye and, during my evening trips back, the windows had often steamed up, the restaurant beginning to burst with life; candles and a steady stream of shadowy figures; the general hustle and bustle that has you curious to know what's inside.\n\nEntering into First Coast, I felt like I'd stumbled into a village bistro. The interior was homely and inviting, with painting hanging on the walls, candles on the tables and a genuinely warm welcome. It's, therefore, no surprise that First Coast is named after a tiny village in Wester Ross. Despite not having booked a table, we were sorted with a table for two in no time. But, a word of warning, I imagine that it would be near impossible to say the same a few hours later. We walked past later and it was full to the brim. A side note: our table was right next to the bathroom, which during peak time, I imagine wouldn't be the best as the space between the table and the bathroom is quite a narrow one. Regardless, this was just a teeny part of our First Coast experience, and a pernickety one at that.\n\nWe were presented with menus printed on paper, which can mean just one thing; an ever-changing menu and fresh, local produce. And, of course! If you click the menu tab on First Coast's website, it states that 'our menu is updated on a regular basis.' This time round, we were spoiled for choice. Just how could I not have seafood in a restaurant with a name like 'First Coast!' The Kerala seafood curry was delicious. With mussels on top, a fresh seafood mix and a delectably flavoursome and creamy sauce. The portion size did leave me craving more but the up-side was that there was room for dessert. Cue several minutes of drooling before finally settling on the rosewater and pomegranate creme brulee; quite possibly the best decision I've ever made. A sweet, rich charred top with a creamy, floral filling and fresh pomegranate seeds. I savoured every mouthful because I didn't want it to end! This is the kind of dessert I'll be dreaming about for a very long time.\n\nPart of the reason I'm so excited to return to First Coast is to try an entirely different menu. This time round, I felt encouraged to try things I wouldn't normally since they weren't permanent options.. - It was all delicious!\n\nAll in all, lovely!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

On my second trip, the same issue I had taken from my first, was repeated once more. Service remains good, even when the restaurant is busy, but other parts of the business disappoint. \n\nThis time, we returned for the Scottish Menu, in celebration of St Andrews Day. The starter was a collection of treats including marag gheal (white pudding), venison (or vegetarian) haggis, cullen skink and grilled mussels with (scottish) cheddar. All in all, I thought the starter was a hit, with the highlight being the cullen skink. Everything was well flavoured and delicious. \n\nFor our mains, the boy had the beef and oyster pie. Turns out it was a singular oyster. For me, I had the kale and crowdie bridie - in effect, a cheese and kale pasty, delivered on a mustard sauce - the sauce was seriously mustardy and unpleasant - and given the bridie sat on said sauce, not much escaping it. \n\nOn the side, clapshot (swede and potato mash), burnt onions and stovies (lamb and potato). Obviously no lamb and potato for the dining vegetarian, and no replacement either, which I felt a little cheated over - after all, I still paid for my uneaten portion of stovies. \n\nIt's a small gripe, but extends a little further - the menu was printed without really paying attention to the vegetarians amongst us - the starter section didn't indicate it was a collection of starters (the boy only wanted soup... but did enjoy the overall selection) and didn't indicate any vegetarian alternatives. The mains, well to be honest, a pasty is a pasty, and I could have bought very similar out of a bakery for a fraction of the cost. The sides - well, I had clapshot and the onions, which was more of a garnish than anything else. The boy's pie looked very lonely, and his skirlie untouched (oats with added bacon in this case). Lamb stovies went down a little better. \n\nAnother gripe I have is timing. While I appreciate starters and mains appear to be freshly prepared, it takes a long time, especially on a busy night. The wait between starter and main reached painful proportions - I don't believe it shold take that long - but it felt that perhaps preparation didn't start til after we had finished our first course. \n\nThe medley of desserts - I didn't really feel there was much to say - echlefechan tart crust was rock hard, with flavours not to my taste; cranachan was pleasant enough. Clootie dumpling and sherry trifle - I just don't like either, and First Coast's version didn't convince me to change my mind. \n\nSo overall, I think First Coast has less promise than I hoped, downgraded as a result. Flickers of the good stuff are shown, but marred by inconsistency across courses.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

This was with a group of 7 on a Saturday during an early December. It was fairly busy and space was at a premium. \n\nWe got a nice table close to the kitchen but located in the 'runway' for waiters and washroom users. \nThis saw on occasion a chef with fresh carcasses passing right behind the seats in the aisle, or a waitress with a full plate of clearings\/dishes. This required constant awareness of myself as a guest knowing who is behind me, carrying what, so I don't make any sudden movements with my arms or chair. This impacted my fun time being with friends ever so slightly. \n\nThe food was very tasty, but the preparation and delivery was some of a let down. \n \nI had a starter of minced beef and onions, well prepared, a bit small.\n\nI ordered steak, medium rare. It was cooked medium. The charcoal taste was nice. I wanted roasted potatoes instead of fat chips. (the roast potatoes were on the menu for a pork belly dish, so they did have them) This was rejected as the steak dish comes out with either new baby potatoes or fat chips according to the waiter. No gravy or sauce available. But we were provided with ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard. As the steak was a bit dry, I'd have preferred it if there was a gravy\/sauce available, but hey-ho.\n\nFor afters, I selected a cheese course. The blue cheese was lighter than it looked to my annoyance, but still with the right amount piled on the oatcake, very pleasant. \n\nIn all I was pleased with the flavours, and I can see that if it was a little less busier, they'd would be able to address some the issue I mentioned above.\n\nCurrently, I cannot recommend going here, but no need to avoid.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I'll swap those morning runs and fruit salads for relaxi-pants till noon, mash, gravy and pies please.\n\nFirst Coast serve far more than mash, gravy and pies but the food us merry bunch of yelpers were served last Wednesday as part of the Yelp Eats meal was certainly comforting, warm and hit the spot perfectly on a frosty evening.\n\nI skipped the starter to leave room for my Coley Fillet with Lentils main. And just as well. That bad boy of a Coley fillet was EPIC. Have a look at my uploaded photo. I wish I'd used a coin to show the scale. The Godfather of Coley fillets. In fact I think 5 of us ordered it and there was a quick guessing game of whose was the biggest (Kerrin said mine, I said Emily's.) All of them were huge, and I have to say mine was deliciously cooked. Grilled with a lovely lemony flavour,but still melt in the mouth and so filling. The lentils were quite a simple accompaniment but anything more would have out-done the star of the plate.\n\nThe baked apple pudding was again simple and rustic but tasted like Christmas. This made me very happy. It was stuffed with dried fruits like raisins, sultanas and some nuts served with icecream and a little caramel sauce. I said I'd only have room for a bite. I think Kerrin managed a teeny bit before I demolished it.\n\nThe restaurant was packed when we arrived at 7pm on a Wednesday and somehow even busier when we left. Yet the staff remained every friendly, attentive and never flapped or seemed rushed. I liked that.\n\nIt was a bit odd that the starters came out really super quickly, then there was about a 40 minute wait for the mains. But good wine and good company meant this wasn't a problem - just a bit odd.\n\nThis is definitely a homely, hearty, comforting neighbourhood restaurant with some quite unusual mixture of offerings on the menu (moroccan inspired aubergine and egg salad flatbread, and chorizo with black pudding stew) alongside British favourites (beef rib with mash and gravy).\n\nI liked that First Coast had its own vibe and stuck to it. I admit my favourite places for a Friday night post-work dinner are slightly more gastro-pubby or also serve cocktails etc. Gotta admit what you like. But if I were wanting somewhere to take the family for a good wintery family dinner out, First Coast would be an ideal spot.\n\nI'm also looking forward to seeing how they switch up their menu for summer as I'm sure they'll do that brilliantly too.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

First Coast was quite full for a mid-week meal, and being located something off the beaten path I took this to be a good sign.  People definitely make a point of coming here.\n\nStarving, I opted for a starter and a main.  That, and I saw the option for black pudding, chorizo and bean stew and thought it sounded fantastic.  \nUnfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was served up very plainly without even a garnish, and while the taste was fine, it wasn't any more than fine.  The black pudding wasn't whole as I'd pictured it but was fully incorporated into the stew so they could well have missed it out and, with so many other rich flavours, you wouldn't even know.  I normally love a chorizo and bean stew, but this particular combo was just a bit too salty and far too rich for my taste in a starter.  \n\nI chose the coley and lentils as my main (which, by the way came some 40 minutes after we finished our starters, which came out like a flash... very strange and inconsistant).  The coley was very generous and was cooked and seasoned well.  By \"generous\" I mean that the portion was massive.  It was disproportionaly massive, compared with the other main meal offerings on the menu.  The lentils were fine, but I focused my limited belly space in attempting to take down as much of the tasty fish as I could.  \n\nBeyond the food, the staff were brilliant.  Definitely some of the nicest wait staff I've come across here and that's saying a lot.  Even with a full restaurant and a number of large tables, they handled it all smoothly and professionally.\n\nOverall, I don't see myself coming here again.

Make it sunny, hit the beach, squint and it could be the Med with a bit of imagination. \n\nHaving once considered moving here and discovering there was a proper tapas restaurant, I had been itching to try it. It came highly recommended by my office mate who had tipped me off about the gluten free options :-)\n\nMalvarosa is a lovely Spanish enclave in the heart of Portobello. With its cosy decor, Spanish chefs and the lovely Alvaro making you feel welcome, it makes visiting Portobello on a rainy day a great option.\n\nI loved the food - lots of GF options, all highlighted in grey. Went for paella and tapas to share between 3 and there was tons of food. My own staple request - tortilla espanola was fab - and cooked properly, the egg not looking too raw or dried out. The garlicky mushrooms were lipsmackingly good and very moreish. I loved the black pudding, milder than Scottish black pudding, but one of two varieties on offer. I  the paella was fab, big chunks of chicken and chorizo, complete with veggies - yum, yum.  \n\nThe service was excellent. This is very much a family restaurant. Alvaro the owner was interested in all his customers and after discovering we weren't local, was keen to know what brought us to Malvarosa. When I discussed my almost house move to Portobello and the office mates recommendation, I was told to thank said office mate for good review. Clearly an owner who cares about his business and his customer experience!\n\nWell worth a visit - planning our next GF lunch here so hopefully returning within the next month - yum, yum.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have nothing against Spanish food but I am always looking for something that will blow me away. There are so many great flavours there and great potential.\n\nI ended up at Malvarosa in an attempt to find somewhere to eat after a trip to Fort Kinnaird. It's a small place, with a nice family feel. You end up sitting pretty close to the kitchen.\n\nWe went for 5 tapas dishes (and some bread) between two of us. We weren't hugely hungry but this seemed a good amount. Overall it was mixed bag; the chorizo bread (which we didn't order but ended up with) was quite cold, and some other bread was a bit hard for my liking. Patas bravas tasted pretty much as it should with a nice kick. Chorizo in cider was nice but I wish it had a bit more punch.\n\nThe haddock bites were a real high point however and the standout dish. Fresh and more-ish. The garlic chicken was also great. The goats cheese onion tarts arrived a while after we finished everything else and were fine but didn't blow me away. It was rounded off with a nice Rioja though. \n\nIt doesn't quite make the 4 stars because although the staff were friendly, the service wasn't quite up to scratch. We had to wait for the dishwasher cycle to finish before getting some drinks, we waited quite a while with our menus and we received some dishes we didn't order and didn't receive some we did.\n\nI think if you like Tapas though this is a safe bet. The food tasted fresh, generally seemed of good quality, and prices are fair. I don't think I would make the trip out to Portobello to come here but if in the area I'd come back.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

As a lover of Tapas and Spanish food combined with an invitingly traditional looking interior, I headed in.\n\nWe were immediately greeted by two very welcoming and friendly ladies serving us. Inside, it feels just like a Spanish tapas bar (as long as you don't look out the window on to Portobello High Street) you can transport yourself straight to Granada.\n\nThe menu is great and offers a good variety of traditional Spanish tapas options as well as some more unique dishes, something I really like in a restaurant. Similarly, they have a well chosen wine listed, sourced from Spanish vineyards. The beers are the standard Estrella, Mahou and Alhambra along with a couple special editions I didn't expect to see. And well priced with my 250ml of white coming in at only £4.60.\n\nTo eat I had marinated anchovies, Potaje de Garbanzos - a chickpea and vegetable stew, Ensalada de Invierno - a mix of sautéed greens and Merluza al Chilindrón - baked Hake with ratatouille. They were all spectacular. The anchovies were served with chopped parsley and plenty garlic - perfect! The chickpea stew was very well flavoured. It had sultanas in it and I don't usually like sweet and savoury at the same time but with a perfect balance of spices and sweetness this Moorish style dish was so nice. The mixed greens were also cooked perfectly; al dente but still with a golden char on the outside.\n\nThe Hake comes with a bit of a story. I was aware it would take a little longer as it was baked in the oven to order (great) It was the last dish to arrive after a very slight wait (only about 5 minutes longer than expected). Despite not having a problem with this at all, our servers were incredibly apologetic, took it off our bill and gave us a complimentary bowl of olives! It was definitely worth the wait. It was beautifully cooked; creamy white, flaky flesh and served with a ratatouille that was massive on flavour.\n\nI have to give a special mention to those olives as well. They are huge, I don't know what they were marinated in but as far as olives go, they were spectacular.\n\nI went through a period of eating my way through Edinburgh's Spanish restaurants and Malvarosa is certainly up there with the best. It has the whole package; great food, great staff, great atmosphere and good value. I think i'll be looking for excuses to visit Portobello more often.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I booked my table by emailing them - which always endears me to restauarants. They were very accommodating when I changed the number of people for my booking - and then didn't chastise us when one of our party didn't turn up.\n\n\n It's also - and this gets lots of brownie points in my book - BYOB. £3 corkage. And they even brought us cava glasses for the cava.\n\n\n The food is fabulous. Principally tapas but imaginatively done. No chorizo in red wine here. They have chorizo with cider, the de rigeur patatas bravas but a less common potatoes with garlic dish and then a whole array of fish, flesh and vegetable alternatives.\n\n\n We had a seafood paella that was plump with mussels, some other shell-y things and king prawns. A lovely hake stuffed dish, chorizo of course, tortilla with chorizo, aubergines with manchego cheese and lovely fat olives.\n\n\n They have an impressive choice of desserts for a Spanish restaurant. And it's all delivered with a charming sparkle that make this new addition to Portobello's High Street a great fun night out.\n\n\n It's all very good value for money. We paid £20 a head as a party of five with the paella, plenty of tapas, desserts, coffee and several corkage charges.\n\n\n Do try it.

They also have the classic Edinburgh selection of lagers and bitters with a few surprises. They have a decent selection of spirits. They also have crisps. \n\nOne of the good things they've done since they took over from the illicit still is to get rid of the enormous TV which was the worst thing that had happened to bars in the last century.\n\nThe space in general REALLY works as a bar. I appreciate the tables, the standing space, the way it works as a bar. However it still feels like it's just not quite there yet.

As the Tourmalet was a refit of the old Dizzy's, Ventoux has replaced the Illicit Still. Cycling enthusiasts will recognise that both pubs are named after (in)famous mountain climbs in the Tour de France. So we can presume that Alpe d'Huez is the next in line.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the bar has a cycling theme, with lots of old school cycling memorabilia on the walls (and a lovely old bike on the ceiling), and while most of this stuff tends inevitably to be French, the beer focus is German. Which means bottled beer, about ten or so at the moment. They also offer the standard booze options and beers on tap are the usual suspects, with only one real ale (Deuchars IPA). \n\nIt's an interesting approach, given that Cloisters (real ale specialist) is a few doors down in one direction, while Brauhaus (specialists in bottled German beers) is about the same distance in the other direction. But I think the draw here is the relaxed, almost café-style atmosphere, and in particular the cycling theme. Given the number of bike shops in Edinburgh, there is obviously a fair number of folk in their 30s and 40s with a bit of spare cash and an interest in this rather expensive hobby. Flash new shops like Ronde in Stockbridge offer coffee and cake and cycling on the tv to entice punters and build a community, and these bars are another attempt to tap into this demographic.\n\nWhile at a pub I normally prefer to have a pint rather than a bottle (therefore I tend to lean more towards Cloisters than Brauhaus), the relaxed vibe and cycling theme are enough to draw me there for another visit. At least it's a place where I can shoehorn into conversations the fact that I've climbed Ventoux myself. Phew. I was starting to worry that I wouldn't find a way to work that into the review.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It's a funny area of town, at the split junction beyond Tollcross. The only other nearby bar is Cloisters: another traditional boozer than has less music and more board games. Ventoux seems to be going for the same style, but on a smaller scale. No music, just some old-fashioned tables, chairs, a hope for locals, and drink. \n\nIt'd be the perfect bar to have as your local with other fun locals, once you start to get that group on the go. As David S has said, it's still finding its feet. It's nice, and the staff are friendly but it seems to lack a certain je ne sais quoi. Something to lend it that \"oh we must go back!\" For Cloisters, its the knowledge you'll get no silly Freshers nonsense, and it's big enough to host a big group, and they have board games and plenty of rotating ales. For the Brass Monkey it's the awesome random live tuneage. For some Cowgate bars, its the fun crowds of randoms and rock-ier scene. I think Ventoux just needs to find its niche. When in the area and wanting a drink, I'd certainly pop in here, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.

I was also a little bemused by the decor, not following cycling it just seemed a little random to me, but it wasn't offensive. The bottle of german beer I had was pleasant and the barman certainly knew enough about the ten or so german beers available in bottles but I likely won't be back in for a while.\n\nI wish the owners luck and I can see potential here if for no other reason than it has a better physical layout than Brauhaus, only time will tell.

And what a choice.\nYou can avoid the difficulty of choosing by opting for a pre-picked selection, but if you want to make sure you get your favourites then it's best to pick them yourself. The ones with chillies or peppers are especially nice, but they also create lots of fragrant flavours which are a bit milder on the tongue.\nOnce you've filled your box they'll wrap it in ribbon and a very fancy bag. The packaging is a work of art in itself.\nAll of this is a little expensive if you're used to buying Black Magic, but the quality is well worth what you pay.\nAs well as the choccies, they also sell cakes and pastries which look very rich and delicious, and selections of tea and hot chocolate to try at home.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Plaisir du Chocolat concentrate on just that: pleasure and chocolate (in addition to having an extremely extensive tea list). I must confess: truth be told, I am not a big chocolate eater. This is why Plaisir du Chocolat is amazing: it will definitely satiate the chocoholic- with multitudinous oferings on the menu- but likewise, it will also satiate the occasional chocolate eater- for the very reason that the chocolate is so first rate. If you eat chocolate about once a year- like me- this is the place to do it. The menu is long and suggests a real devotion to chocolate of all types and of all percentages- I've never seen so many dark chocolates on offer. In addition, there are lovely alcoholic selections- naughty hot chocolates and coffees which add to the, I hasten to say, sinful factor of the whole shebang. The prices will be more expensive than say a family size Dairy Milk at Tesco. This is reasonable as the calibre of the chocolate is supreme- and the craftmanship that has gone into creating the products in stunning. If you are totally broke, you'll head to elsewhere to satiate that sweet tooth. But if you've got some flexibility in the pocket book or its a special occasion, Plaisir du Chocolat is for you. Saying that, and also, being pretty poverty stricken myself, I must say, that the prices are not astronomical- and if you like, for instance, Mocha Lattes- this would be a far better place to get them than at, say Starbucks- for many reasons including, the quality is much higher here and the money goes to an independent Edinburgh business. This is definitely a place you would bring visiting friends or family to, a place where tourists should stop in, and where residents of Edinburgh should head when they have a craving for chocolate.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The staff are very polite and attentive.\n\nI couldn't quite work out if the place was a restaurant or a cafe, looking around I was noticing some people sitting down to a dinner with a glass of wine and others were simply drinking coffee and chatting. This I found a little strange but maybe this is the feel the owners are going for.\n\nI had the soup and lamb moussaka lasagne and my fiancee had the Kofte Gratin, all were very well cooked, not too salty and were delivered well on the plate, you even got a little dolma on your plate which I have been missing since my last time in Turkey almost 2 years ago. After dinner we had a look at their cakes which take up a large portion of their front counter. Everything from Carrot cake to tiramisu and all of them looked beautiful.\n\nThe decor of the place was very 1990's Scottish cafe. Woodwork that was in need of a little varnish, carpets that had a design that Pink Floyd couldn't create at their most \"creative\" and couches that had almost the same design as the carpet that hadn't been touched up in quite a long time.\n\nOverall we had a very nice and enjoyable night and would recommend people to try here if you are at this end of the Royal Mile and fancy something different for dinner.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I felt it was time to let the world know about this unsung hero. OK, they're a chain. But an Edinburgh chain, and a small one. And the Marchmont Road branch seems like a little community area all in itself. It's pretty expensive as corner shops go, but it does have a really good range of products, many far more up market than you would expect from what is basically a grocery store \/ newsagent. You can get deli bread, meats and cheeses and there's a huge range of cakes, chocolate and wine. They also sell the most amazing chocolate fudge cake by the slice, and various home-made favourites like rocky road. The fresh veg isn't great, but the service more than makes up for it - what a friendly bunch! Today the monotony of essay-writing was broken up by the suggestion that I might like to freeze my grapes - \"they're like little ice lollies!\" Given that I've had a solitary time of next to no banter, this delighted me.

You know when you keep giving somewhere just another chance because it used to be good? Well, I think last night was the night I gave up. \n\nI used to love Khushi's in Victoria Street. It was a dramatic building, and I had some great food there. \n\nThen it burnt down, and they moved to a fairly boring cellar under the Pear Tree and - I don't know, seemed to lose their way. Sauces were boring and tasted 'out of a jar', and worse, the staff would positively force feed you to get you out fast. But I reasoned to myself that I had gone during the festival and at Christmas, and nowhere is at its best when it's so busy. \n\nFinally, Khushi has its new home, in Antigua Place at the top of Leith Walk. It's taken over a big space that used to be Massimo's (I miss Massimo's), and from the outside it looks bright and cheerful and the place-to-be. \n\nSo last night I called and asked for a reservation for four. They had a table, though we'd have to be out in 90 minutes. That seemed fair, we just wanted a quick meal. \n\nFrom the second we arrived, though, it all went wrong. We were shown into a bare 'overspill' room off to the side, harassed to order fast, and then the unsmiling waiter announced that he'd 'bring your starters and mains at the same time, because you have to be out soon'. Charming...\n\nAnd so he did, slapped everything down and off he went, to practise his lack of social skills on someone else. \n\nThe food was okay, I suppose - fish pakora were tasty, the veg pakora a bit dry for my liking. My tandoori monkfish - I've had it before there and loved it, but last night it was a bit overcooked. And... maybe not actually monkfish? The texture just wasn't quite right so I was suspicious. \n\nAnyway, we ate, we got full. Mostly it was basic British Indian food in over-creamy sauces. And we were finished long before the time they were due to throw us out.\n\nThere are too many good restaurants in Edinburgh to have to put up with actively rude service.

So let's get to it because it was over the top great.\n\nI ordered the Lamb Curry with rice it may have another name but thats what it was it was cubed lean lamb grilled and folded into a red curry that was to die for, when ordering I wanted to ensure it was authentic and as hot and spicy as I could get it after all this part of the world can offer up some rather bland cuisine (no offense). I asked the server how hot could I get it he told me as hot as I wanted so I told him extra extra extra spicy and make sure the chef understands. After munching on the naan for awhile our dishes finally arrived the girls were served first then the chef delivered mine and he and two others stood at our table to make sure we were happy with the dishes we order...... Well that is not exactly true they were there to see my reaction to their atomic curry that I was sure they amped up as much as possible since I was so insistence when I ordered.  \n\nBefore I jumped in I asked for a refill of water anticipating the worst, I carefully spooned my rice onto my dish and ensured I had the proper ratio of rice to atomic curry to dilute it if required and then my first bite. The tender lamb melted in my mouth it had the most wonderful texture and it was followed by this intense heat that I had been craving for over a week. Yes it was extremely hot and the chef and his small group of kitchen help were surprised I went for another bite instead of the water glass I looked up with a smile and gave them the thumbs up and off they went to leave me with my plate of pleasure, as soon as they were gone from sight I quickly grabbed the glass of water to extinguish the fire in my mouth it was hot but I enjoy extremely hot food so I was able to eat it all and enjoyed every bite.

Kind of on the way somewhere but neither here nor there. Intermediate but not central (as we say in the geography biz).

And he told us the starters would come with the mains because we had to be out. Didn't ask us, or make it friendly or anything. Come on, how long does it take to cook, serve and eat a few pakora? As it turned out, we finished with plenty of time to spare. The food was decent. Quite reliable quality but nothing out of the ordinary. And continued rude service throughout the meal.\n\nQ.

A week of country eating (albeit GOOD eating!) had us craving a bit of heat. And so back to the city we headed, parked our trusty four-wheeler, and went off on another exploratory stroll down Leith St. A wee twist here, a skip there, a bop and a hop and a random waddle brought us to good fortune... and some really lovely eats. Jackpot!\n\nTo be honest I don't have a spanking idea of what we ordered, but ooooh was it sparkling good. And spicy. That really lovely wonderful fantastic kicks-you-in-the-sinuses-then-turns-into-smooth-all-over-happiness kind of spicy. They do a mean curry - mean in a good way. The good kind of mean that makes you cry tears of culinary joy. Naan was crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. Did I order a salad? I have no recollection - but there it was. Usually that's the last thing I'd ever get at an Indian joint, but the light vegetable break was a welcome pause to the otherwise fiery choices. Maybe they just knew - they took one simple glance at me and they knew - she's going to need a handful of non-spicy, fresh and light vegetables to counter the (wonderful!) pain. She asked for extra spicy, that silly girl.\n\nOh now don't be frightened off by all my blethering on about a few chilis. I love the spicy food - I just can't handle it as well as I think I can. Plenty of excellent options on the menu to certainly satisfy all grades of taste and preference. The neighboring table had ordered the mixed grill and had my cup not been overflowing, we might have shamelessly requested one for our table - it looked fantastic. We got lucky in finding Khushi's - the service was great, very thorough and attentive. The waiter never once laughed (in my face) as he brought extra napkins for me to wipe down my brow. And he was most kind and sympathetic when more water and lassi was ordered to cool the mouth. Even amateurs like us were warmly welcomed and treated - wooooo!\n\nA tad bit on the pricier side but the food and drinks went down well.

The Khushi reputation clearly drives a great trade.... \n\nHaving made an \"executive\" decision to dine from the Christmas set menu (£18.95 pp), minimising the agonies  of making a selection from the vast a-la carte and the squabbles over \"who had what\" when it came to paying the bill, I was very impressed with the selection (and quantity) of the offering. \n\nA pre-starter of Pickles and Popadoms kept us going while we waited for the last few of the party to arrive, followed by a variety of starters including the typical Chicken Tikka, Onion Bhajii and Pakora. The main course selection included a tender Lamb Jalfrezi, tasty Fish Curry and Chicken Korma, served with rice and Naan. There was something to cater for the taste of everyone. It was a perfect way to try a selection of different dishes.\n\nThe food was served buffet style and there was plenty to go around, I'd be surprised if anyone could have managed dessert after such a feast. \n\nCoupled with the BYOB offering with no corkage charge, the night was a success....great value for money. My only niggle would be the constant reminder from the waiting staff of the two hour booking slot, not only to me but also to some of my guests which I felt added an unnecessary sense of urgency to the experience. \n\nWill definately visit again to dine from the a-la carte menu.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It is a mixed platter of chicken tikka, prawn, lamb chop and seekh kebab. The chicken tikka was my favourite - I didn't know chicken can be so melt in the mouth stuff! \nThe platter came with a simple chickpea salad and we shared a naan bread. \n\nThe service at times felt a bit rushed. I'm not sure if this is because they really are so popular (e.g. a couple could not get a table as they had no reservation) and it was a Friday. Howerver the food was nice.

I only take off points because the breads and accompaniments were lacklustre.  Being Scotland, I figured lamb was the way to go and I wasn't wrong.  I expected the tandoori lamb chops to be dry, but they came wet: smothered in a delicious green-chili based sauce.  And although it was a bit pricey (I think the most expensive thing on the menu,) there were a huge number of chops: it was basically a whole rack of lamb (which from that perspective made it very reasonable.)  A paneer side dish was good too.  But as I mentioned before, the breads left something to be desired.  Also, like many other Indian restaurants in Edinburgh, there is no liquor, but unlike many other Indian restaurants in Edinburgh, they have an arrangement with the pub upstairs so you can get beer sent down.  Also, it was a little hard for me to find because although centrally located (near the university and within easy walking distance of the Royal Mile) it's on WEST Nicholson Street, not Nicholson Street.

It was busy and quite noisy. We had a reservation, which seemed necessary judging by how crowded it was.\n\nThere were 8 of us and we shared a selection of starters. The others ate lamb whilst I only ate the potato pakoras and the chickpea chat with coriander sauce. Both were pretty good. I ordered rice and a small portion (£4.95) of a spicy paneer dish as my main. The portion was sufficient and many people on my table had too much naan so I had to help... The curry wasn't the best I have had but certainly not the worst. The spice level was pretty good though. The basmati rice which came with the meal felt a little plasticy-maybe reheated? The naan was a little too dry too. Most of us got a mango lassie to go with our meal which was average, it is difficult to mess up, though I had to ask for them to bring ice to the table as they weren't cold.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the meal time entertainment. A waiter spilt some coriander sauce on one of my friend's jackets. After apologising profusely the waiter came back with a bucket and a sponge and ended up giving my friend a complimentary massage\/scrub which lasted for a good 10 minutes whilst my friend was laughing silently.\n\nOverall, lovely staff, but my bill came to £16.45, strange considering I opted small portions and the food was pretty mediocre.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

If you're not boozing, then you have to try their home-made fruit juice creations... I went for the Cucumber, Mint and Rock Salt, and although it sounds more than a little bit weird it was actually really tasty! The carrot and orange was a close second place.\n\nThe starters will set you back £3-5 each, and you could do a lot worse than the Sunhari Jhinga (king prawns fried in spiced batter... crispy and amazing). The mains range from £7-12, although they're not hugely imaginative - all the predictable dishes you'd expect to find on the menu in an Indian place. \n\nBeing predictable, however, doesn't stop them from being delicious.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

However I went with an open mind and... my worst fears were confirmed. All atmosphere and quirkiness has been sucked out of the market. Fancy a Schneemann Punsch or Fire Punch to warm up? You're out of luck - these stalls have been replaced by half a dozen identical 'hot apple toddy' stalls, all run by the same company, and look very commercial and branded.\n\nThe ice rink has been moved from the bottom of Princes' St gardens to a spot near the Scott Monument, creating a bottleneck where the crown grinds to a halt, and is possibly dangerous and definitely a pickpocket's paradise. Other parts of the market had few people walking around when I was there on a normally extremely busy Saturday afternoon. Ironically there was also a bottleneck in the area where the hot drinks stalls had been in previous years, presumably from people heading there expecting them to be there.\n\nTo end on a positive note, the stalls at the bottom of The Mound have been spread out slightly more than in previous years, creating more space, but all in all, it's nowhere near as good as in previous years. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It's pretty much what you expect. Mulled wine. Waffles. Hog Roast. Random wooden knock-knacks. Gimmicky flavoured coffee. And plenty of sausages.\n\nSince being taken over by Underbelly in 2013 the Christmas Market has become more and more commercial and less distinct. The drinks bars and stalls are all uniform; same drinks same and same high prices. It's worth searching out for the remaining authentic German\/European stalls that don't have the 'Edinburgh Christmas' branding. \n\nIn years past there have been more exciting food stalls but there doesn't seem to be much here you  wouldn't find at a football match. Overall it just doesn't feel exciting. The Virgin Street of Light demonstrates that there is room for something new and different at Edinburgh Christmas. The market in comparison feels tired.\n\nYou can probably add an extra star if you're a tourist or Buddy the Elf.

The place was very quiet and we got nice comfy sofas.  After much deliberation and getting up to see the board of specials, which you cannot read unless you are close, we opted for omelettes.  I ordered salmon and spinach, and my friend spinach, salmon and onion.  We also ordered some coffees.  The first coffees arrived reasonably quickly, then we waited for our omelettes, and waited, and waited, and waited.  After a very long wait, the waiter eventually brought them to us.  We agreed that they were very nice and well cooked.  But surely, in an almost empty cafe, one shouldn't have to wait about 40 mins for an omelette, which after all, doesn't take that long to make.\nThen we decided to have some cake, and another coffee.  We had spotted a gluten-free coffee cake, which looked very nice. Again, we waited, and waited.  The cakes eventually arrived, followed by the coffees.  How disappointing, we were expecting a nice moist guy cake, and it was dry, very dry!\nOverall an average experience, the coffee is OK, the omelettes are good, the cakes, well, maybe we were just unlucky...  But there is no excuse to make customers wait that long when there are hardly any other customers.\nHowever, as the place is quiet, I would go back for coffee with my laptop to do some work as it is not packed with kids which is totally an advantage compared to the place next door.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

And what an omlette it was.\n\nI'm just going to come out and state the obvious. Cuthberts is right next to one of my favourite cafés in Edinburgh, Loudons. They're literally side-by-side and the only decent big, free wifi cafés in the area.\n\nI really can't choose a favourite, so I will also come out and say I like them both equally but for different reasons. I won't turn this review into a side-by-side comparison so let me just continue to say what it is I really like about Cuthberts, and why I'll be willing to trek the 25 minute walk there from my flat for breakfast (quite often I imagine too).\n\nThe ambience inside is really nice. It's quite quiet, and seems perfectly prepped for professionals looking for a quiet place to read the paper, check emails, have breakfast meetings etc. There's even 1.5L bottles of mineral water in the fridge, which really struck me at first, until I saw the many suited, booted types holding breakfast meetings and realised how clever Cuthberts were in providing the business-meeting-catering essentials.\n\nThe staff are friendly, and it seems family run. I really like the decor. A bit sumptuous, comfy, but also relaxed. There's a mixture of sofas, booths, and tables. The only thing I would say is it was a little cold, it was freezing outside, and they didn't seem to have turned the heating up to compensate.\n\nI admit from the outside I thought Cuthberts might cater standard café fayre with the standard carrot cake with the iced carrot on top that half of Edinburgh cafés provide, all from the same supplier. I was wrong. The most delicious handmade cakes, tray bakes, scones, cheesecakes were on offer.  \n\nThe menu itself is really quite large too. A little pricey for certain items (£4.95 for museli, add more for fresh fruit?) but as well as eggs, bacon etc. there were pancakes, waffles, french toast, lots of different fillings, omlettes.\n\nMy omelette was huge. Probably a 3 or 4 egg one I'd wager. Stuffed with delicious bacon and spinach and cooked to perfection. Not greasy at all (as can sometimes be a downfall of any Scottish breakfast option).\n\nThe soups looked delicoius, and it seems everything is home-made. \n\nThey do movie nights too, with lots of Christmas themed ones running through December. \n\nIt's a little out my way, but as I've already said, I'd happily trek here for breakfast. It's home-made, hand-made, friendly, delicious and fresh. And there's free wifi. See me, with my laptop, here often!\n\nNote: I realise I have spelt omeltte wrong, in many different variations throughout this review, but I can't for the life of me figure out the correct spelling. I will come back and update later.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Ben previously worked at Nordic Food Lab and following this, at the studio, unusual and traditional ingredients are presented in new ways with an open kitchen so diners can see the dishes in progress and large communal tables.\n\nI came for dinner last week as Roddie Loan who supplies seafood to michelin starred Noma was here. Roddie left Norway at 3am on Thursday morning with clams, sea urchins and seaweeds, plus aqua vite to cook for lucky Edinburgh punters who managed to get booked in for his Arctic Feast. \n\nWhat a feast it was! I'd never had sea urchins before and the inner five year old was mesmerised watching them still move, even after we'd eaten the insides. They were lovely and sweet. We followed this with clams and mussels - fab. Then came clam tartare and my gluten free version came with buckwheat and beautifully earthy scarlet capped mushrooms. Cod with beautiful buttery mash followed and then dessert was an\nNorwegian rice pudding with cinnamon and butter. Sounds weird but was lovely. I didn't get cheese and instead had a sea buckthorn sorbet which was both savoury and sweet.\nThroughout, Roddie and Ben talked us through the dishes, telling stories and providing a really great night.

My distinct memory of this trip was when we went to have our photo taken like these tourists attractions do. So my dad is put in the stock (is that the right word? The thing you put your head and arms in) and gave me an axe to hold over his head. Now being 7 years old I thought the axe was real and it weighed a tonne making me panic that I was going to chop my dad's head off. So we have this lovely family photo with every one smiling except me, who looks completley terrified. It was only recently I came to terms with the fact that a. it wasn't a real axe, and b. I wasn't actually going to chop my dad's head off. It was traumatic though.\n\nSo my granny took me here recently. Seriously, my Granny is a social fiend and should have her own Yelp account because most of my reviews stem from places she has taken me. Anyway. Edinburgh has a fantastic history so it is perfect for the Dungeons. They cover everything from Burke and Hare to William Wallace, and they do it in a frickin scary way. The actors are brilliant and quite frightening, everything from the hair and make up to their persona's is so well thought out. There is this boat ride that still haunts me to this day. I was seated in the back corner and upon realizing that I was in the pitch black I decided someone was going to jump up behind me, so I promptly screamed. For no reason. This quickly triggered every other female and child to scream, while everyone else looked around clueless.\n\nI am a massive wimp so everything scared the wits out of me here. It is quite a fun day out, but not cheap if you are taking the whole family. I'm not sure how scared younger kids would be by this, if your kid is a big hard man then probably not too scary, but if your kid is scared of the dark not the best attraction I think.

I don't know too much myself, so it was interesting going online later and looking up people like Sawney Bean and others that show up in the Edinburgh Dungeon. The Green Lady was our favorite, I think. She was one of the new \"attractions\".\n\nWe bought our tickets in the massive building right out front of the Edinburgh Castle.

And this is all for an expensive entry as well! My advice to those visiting Edinburgh is that you are in a very historic City with plenty of open air tours offered to real (quite scary) locations so why pay to see a replica of something you can walk to and see down the street ?

The actors are fantastic and the sets and props as gory as you can stomach! What is most disturbing though is that all the different attractions are based on real events that took place in and around Edinburgh. \n\nThe Anatomy Theatre tells the story of medical autopsies in Edinburgh in the 1820s and how a shortage of bodies led to a couple of unsavory characters doing despicable things to up the death rate! \n\nThe Extremis Drop Ride is based on the hangings which used to take place at Grassmarket and was a bit too much for my delicate nature but if you like scary rides which make you want to be sick then you'll love it! \n\nMary Kings Close is where hundreds of plague victims were left to rot in Edinburgh in the 1640s. Mary King apparently haunts the close seeking revenge and the Edinburgh Dungeon team has got this section disturbingly accurate, right down to the smell of rotting flesh, yuck. \n\nThere is a boat ride called the Cave of Sawney Bean. Sawney Bean was a mass murdering cannibal who killed travelers in order to feed his family of 46, the family being so large due to numerous incestuous relationships, lovely. Eventually the family was caught after they had killed over 1000 people. The men of the family had their limbs hacked off and were left to bleed to death where as the women and children were burned alive, double lovely!\n \nThere is also a William Wallace section where you hear his infamous story told by one of his followers.

But one of the most rewarding to visit is the Museum of Childhood. This treasure trove has been thrilling children and adults alike since opening in 1955 (the first of its kind in the world).\n\n\n To enter this remarkable location is to truly step back in time, through centuries of toys, games, train-sets and costumes, sometimes into your own childhood. The tenements surrounding this setting were built at a time when housing was crammed into the available room. But this makes for a compact exhibition area, creating a more intimate feel than some cavernous modern gallery. Everything is catalogued with concise descriptions in index cards. Getting close to the displays you can appreciate how items were relished by former owners. There are also audio records  you can listen to 1930s schoolkids reciting maths tables  and depictions of traditional street games in the 1950s.\n\n\n Displays are arranged according to historic periods, so as well as providing an interesting glimpse into how our younger ancestors amused themselves, the museum presents a priceless ongoing social history.\n\n\n Some of the older dolls do look crudely pinned together but in today's climate of mobile phones and PlayStations, it is humbling to be plunged into a world where children relied on nothing more than imagination. One of my own earliest memories of this museum is particularly vivid. It was a simple slot-machine where you poked in a halfpenny, then witnessed the re-enactment of the demon barber, Sweeney Todd, transforming his customers into meat pies. As a child brought up in the 1960s it is a wonderful experience seeing toys, games, football cards, Airfix kits or soldiers that I can remember spending carefree hours playing with, preserved for generations to come.\n\n\n After completing your tour there is a well-stocked gift shop, providing ample souvenirs to remind you of this spellbinding exhibition.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I avoid babysitting\/making awkward conversation with children at all costs, just because I'm truly rubbish at it, so this doesn't really apply to me, but I know other humans like to wander about with their kids or wee cousins or whatever, so this could be an idea for a few hours of wandering. People of any age would get enjoyment out of the museum though, so after all that child blarb, I'm basically now saying that you should all attend the museum, all of you!\n\nAnyway, this was apparently the first museum in the world to specialise in the history of childhood, and it's packed with toy relics, and more recent toy memorabilia. There is also some history on the way children have been brought up, and dressed over the years.

This has always surprised me as although the Museum of Edinburgh or The People's Story down the road is a little more out the way, The Museum of Childhood is in tourist central.\n\nThe Museum is basically a collection of toy, games and playthings from different periods of mostly  the 19th and 20th century, starting with the Victorians where the modern idea of Children's toys derives. The Museum isn't really a deep meditation on the nature of childhood, at least not in any obvious way, and any sort of greater meaning will be arrived at personally. Rather it is a display of both historical novelty and recent nostalgia. In particular I enjoyed the large room absolutely filled to the brim with dolls from different period and around the world. Whilst the museum is almost solely western focused, this was an interesting comparison of not only different time but different space.\n\nWhen I'm in the Museum of Childhood I'm really pleased to see the intrigue of contemporary children of childhood past. It gives me hope that children are not now solely mindless occupiers of a digital world.

Lit by candlelight, I'll admit we were both dazzled and navigating closely set tables was a bit challenging. Nonetheless, despite the number of tables, the darkness made it still feel us feel separated and having our own experience, rather than shared with others. \n\nDinners wise we had the option of the Christmas or A La Carte menu, which was wonderful, for my partner loves to have a non Christmas meal for his birthday. Vegetarian options were lovely, and my partner loved his pheasant boudin.

I regret it.\n\nMost noticeably, service was extremely slow. Our total visit was three hours to be served the prix fixe menu: An appetizer, entree, and dessert. We spent long stretches sitting at an empty table, mostly after the appetizer and before the entrees. Before even receiving dessert, we had already asked for the bill and paid so we could leave as soon as possible. On leaving the restaurant, we both felt that time had been stolen away from us. The server apologized for the delay, citing that a large party was occurring in the other room. If a restaurant like Rhubarb is going to offer private parties, it should make sure it can adequately serve its other guests as well.\n\nSome of the dishes were excellent, and others were just okay, like the mango dessert. I ordered the mushroom entree, and it was one of the most unique dishes I've eaten. Unfortunately, my wife's pork dish was too salty. The server had the dish replaced without asking whether or not she wanted it replaced or wanted a different dish. Service also wasn't particularly attentive and very slow as it seemed he was also serving guests in a far away room. I expected better service from such a pricey restaurant. \n\nThe ambience was absolutely the best part of the restaurant and the reason why I booked the restaurant. The eye-popping dining room was tastefully decorated completely in black, red and gold. I felt like I was inside an elegant vampire's palace.

We arrived about 7pm as the sun was shining on the nearby Arthurs Seat, sat in the garden having a glass of bubbles then went inside to eat. The foor was artistic and delicious, I had some game bird with vegetables which was perfectly cooked and washed down with a very tasty rioja. Desert was a take on a rhubarb crumble if my memory serves me right and was as good as it gets. \n\nThe second visit was for afternoon tea. Again, lvoely sunny day, sat our on the lawn. You get an option of two menu's, one with bubbly and one without. We went with. You get the traditional tea which you tuck into as peacocks parade around you. \n\nThe staff are always there, but never there, just far away to not be noticed, which means you get to enjoy your food. There is a lot of emphasis put on service and it shows. Other times I've been there have been a number of well to do visitors eating in the place, all of which add to the feel of Rhubarb. It is a fine dining experience, well worth the money.

The mussels were large and fresh, though the broth was a bit watery. For a main, the 8 oz. Scottish beef fillet was grilled to absolute perfection, and came with a delicious green peppercorn and brandy sauce. Accompanied by caramelized mixed vegetables and sweet potato mash (which we requested in place of the hand-cut chips) was a combination that left us full to the brink of discomfort.\n\n\n Our bill for two, including 4 glasses of wine, two starters, two fillet steaks with sides, and a coffee came to 70 pounds.

How they manage to produce 3 courses of such quality for £14.95 is a wonder. Service was always efficient and polite and mostly timely. The occasional cobweb in view and the misspelling of California on the wine list were minor quibbles. All 3 of us began with the Goats Cheese Crumble w\/ Beetroot. For main I had the Turkey Fillet (ordering a side-dish of veg with this might be a good idea for some), whilst the girls enjoyed the sirloin on one hand and the Pea Risotto on the other. To finish I plumped for the Banana & Peanut Cheesecake which was an acquired taste but I certainly got what I asked for and the portion size rivals Howie's famous Banoffe Pie. The Chilean Cab. Sauv. I washed my food down with was a decent little number too (half bottle £12). Definitely one to go back to. Stopped back in here for Afternoon Tea at the end of last week. Good vfm at £14.95 (like most hotels the bar prices are steeper than average though) but could have done with jam to go with the scones & cream and I imagine there are probably other places in town that have an edge over it for this sort of thing. If you go though take the option of having it in the garden at the rear as it's much more chilled than the bar or lobby.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I spent about £15 on two books which, to be fair, were authoritative versions.\nIn favour of The Edinburgh Bookshop, however, its website posts a 'book of the week' and there is also a weekly reading group which meets in the shop itself.

The decor is plain and evidently done on a budget, which some people might consider an off-putting factor, but those of you out there who are after a more exotic menu and mouth-watering, endlessly marinated and juicy food will do well to persist with the Nile Valley. There are only a handful of tables upstairs, but the basement can accommodate larger groups. But its the food that makes this restaurant stand out- the highlights of the North African cuisine being Couscous, marinated chicken, grilled lamb chops and river fish, all oozing with flavours and spices, served by friendly if a bit inefficient staff. And did I mention the starters? Well worth getting at least one to share, with falafel, cheeses, fresh produce and flavour, flavour, flavour. If you are open-minded, patient, and ready for a meal unlike any you have previously had then the Nile Valley is the place for you.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It does get busy at lunch time so opt for getting there early or late lunch if you want to eat in or avoid the queues.\n\n\n Delicious mango, guava, and hibiscus drinks transports you on a mini holiday.

Coming from one of the restaurant Meccas of the world I may be a bit more critical than others.   The menu is set up for options of the sets of pre-fixe courses: 4, 6, and 8 with an option of wine pairing as well.  It does not mention it on the menu but you can also do an a la carte as well if you wanted, say, both of the starter options. \n\nAmbience:\n\nOverall I found the space to be a bit too cavernous for my liking.  The online pics make it appear to look like a minimalist rustic space which it achieves but in the evening it just seemed a bit empty despite most tables being full.  It's definitely a quiet date place rather than a \"fun\" spot to go with a bunch of friends.  I was alone and it wasn't the right spot for that.\n\nFood:\n\nThey source local and fresh ingredients.  The food is prepared very well.  The portions are very small but they do place a lot of emphasis on presentation and flavor combinations.  The favorite was the the raw beef starter.  I only tried 3 plates as I had eaten not too long before. The scallop dish had two very small scallops.  The duck was one cross slice of breast and a tiny piece of confit and heart.\n\nService:\n\nWaiters were quite pleasant overall.  Service was slow.   The down time between dishes was probably 20-30 minutes and the dishes so small that they can be eaten in less than 5 minutes taking very slow bites.  I actually was never asked if I wanted another drink.   It was not busy in there by any means.  Not sure if this is always the case or was just the night.\n\nOverall:\n\nI always appreciate restaurants that source local ingredients and creatively prepares them and Scotland produces some of the finest seafood and meat in the world.   The concept is good but I just don't love pre-fixe formats.  The portions are tiny and the price is high.  On a date with the 8 course meal with lots of time to get to know your partner I could recommend it.  By yourself just looking for a good local meal I may move on.  I think the website was deceptive in that I thought it would be kind of a cool casual \"farm to table\" type place where you could enjoy some friendly banter with other patrons, but it is really more of an upscale restaurant with rustic features.  As always your mileage may vary.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Portion wise, I have to warn you that it is very artistic on a tiny side.  A bit annoyed by it as I believe they shouldn't be too stingy with it.  I am unsure what they are trying to achieve with this and probably the reason why they lost a star.  I only realised that portion were smaller on my second visit after about 1 year.

They were pretty booked up, but we were able to get a 9:30pm Tuesday reservation for 1 of the 2 nights we were in Edinburgh.\n\nThe setting is very unique with lots of wood, high ceilings, and a sort of barn\/loft feeling.  There are 4, 6, and 8 course options with pescetarian and vegetarian versions available.  Since we got there at the last seating, they had only the 4 and 6 course.  We opted for the 6 course (£65 per person).\n\nTo start: \n- Malt bread with whipped compressed butter and herbs\n- Seed cracker with roe, onion, and a burnt apple sauce\n- Mushroom and tarragon broth over raw mushrooms: a bit under-salted for me. The bowl sat in a larger bowl of porcini mushrooms, and I wished I could have gone for some of those\n\nDrinks:  £12 each.\n1. Tomato, stout, peat, rye: very peaty and spirit driven with light tomato flavor - very interesting, but you need to like peaty whisky (which I do)\n2. Pickled nectarine, spruce, mead, whisky: lighter, slightly fruity and effervescent, probably the sweetest of the ones we tried. This is a good one to start with\n3. Beetroot, damson, lovage, and rye: it looked like beet juice, but it was well balanced; the lovage added an almost medicinal herb flavor \n4. Bramble, egg yolk, vinegar, eau de vie: you could taste the vinegar like a light shrub. The yolk was interesting since most drinks use egg white\n\nWe also did some wines by the glass, which come in 125 ml pours. They have a pretty extensive wine list with a lot of wines I've never heard of before.\n\nFood:\n1. Smoked eel: served warm, with beets, horseradish, and buttermilk\n2. Raw scallop: diced with apple, topped with a bright green parsley sauce, sliced celeriac, and smoked roe. This was a good crudo dish \n3a. Plaice: with oyster leaf and oyster, tons of flavor \n3b. Mallard: the other option for this course, with fermented grains and chantarelles. The mallard was medium rare, a bit gamey for me, but it was good \n4. Duck egg: with shaved black truffles, artichoke, smoked butter, and mushrooms. This was definitely my favorite dish. The egg was soft cooked and runny, and I wiped up every last drop of this dish with my bread \n5a. Trout: very tender, served with broccoli and herbs - a lighter dish\n5b. Beef: super tender, medium rare, very well seasoned. It came with various carrots, kale, and cabbage. I preferred the beef for this course, but both were excellent\n6. Berries: with noble fir snow, fruit leather, ice cream, buttermilk. This had lots of textures and colors and was a nice lighter dish \n\nThe main course portions were substantial and larger than I expected, which was great since I liked the beef a lot. I left very satisfied but not overly full. \n\nThere was a lot of attention to detail - all of the glassware (Riedel, interesting shapes) and dishes were carefully chosen and complemented the drinks\/dishes well.  They were also great about refilling my water (complimentary sparkling water!), which I was basically chugging after a long day of travel.  All of the cocktails were innovative and used interesting seasonal ingredients in unusual combinations. I was very happy for some whisky based cocktails after being in London (so much gin..) and Dublin.\n\nSince we were the last seating and opted for the 6 course, our meal was a bit rushed, especially for the earlier courses, but pacing got better in the end.  We were the last table left, but they still offered tea, coffee, cheese at the end, so it didn't feel like we were being kicked out.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The lighting is great and all the staff very helpful and exude a cool without pretension. I used to come to this place when they did illegal parties in it during it's time between an actual joinery yard and now so is interesting to see the transformation. Always noise complaints from the neighbours when I was there, I wonder how much they had to spend on sound proofing!!\n\nWine list and cocktails are very good, competitively priced with an eye on local sourcing. Had a couple cocktails and they didn't disappoint, Nyetimber is listed which is always nice to see and keenly marked.\n\nWhat really let me down is the food here. For an Edinburgh local perception I think they hit all the high notes however for me it was lacking in several aspects. Edinburgh excels in many of these places that are aspiring for the style of substance brigade. If the food could be as good as the space suggests it would be amazing. Cooking was a little sloppy and it was a shame with the great ingredients they are obviously trying to show.\n\nI believe this is a family run affair, with their son headlining the kitchen. (as of the last time I went). I think they need some other influences. They are obviously great restaurateurs (although I did not particularly like their previous incarnations, but they must have had something successful as they were in existence for so long.)

It can be a pretty intimidating menu, as explanation is minimal - you're given a list of featured ingredients and not much else. But trust, my friends. these people know what they'e doing.\n\nAfter polisihing off the home made bread and whipped butter (all future butter in my life must be whipped), our starters arrived beautifully presented. Tender mallard, sweet popping elderberries and a range of other flavours that just held the whole thing together. the Hake main was equally amazing, with plenty of contrasting textures and flavours that kept your palate interested.\n\nIf theres one point I want to make here, it's Trust; even if their menu reads as easily as ancient greek at times, I recommend picking your protein and letting the kitchen do the rest. Worked for my tastebuds!","useful":5,"funny":4,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

Before I start its a belter! The restaurant itself is stunning - reclaimed wood dominating the tables, small number of art pieces and would you believe I even noticed the radiators! Yes the radiators! We opted for the 6 course tasting menu and paired wines, we couldn't quite bring ourselves to do the 8 course menu. All food is seasonal and local so it is constantly changing. We had raw venison, crab, duck, trout, lamb or halibut for the fifth round (so we had one of each) and topped off with a refreshing sorbet and buttermilk biscuit. The wine pairings were clever including non fermented sherries through to cider through to small batch hand crafted reds and whites. We couldn't fault a single thing!  Now finally the service - we must have had 6 servers possibly more throughout the evening and every single one as courteous, knowledgeable, friendly as the next one. In truth this made the evening, they have it down to an absolute tea! Now there's always a bit of a niggle with any restaurant and this is no exception, so I want to ensure this review is balanced and not completely gushy - the gripe at this restaurant  was the paper napkin!

I didn't go there for food, just some birthday drinks before I headed to dinner. I have heard rave reviews about their food, but knew they had drinks so thought I would try it. It is a beautiful space, we were seated near the entrance, which I assume is the waiting area, which despite the door opening and closing and letting the cold in, was ok. \n\nWe asked the staff member that sat us if we order from the bar or if someone comes to us, they said someone will come to us and gave us menus. So, over 10 minutes later no one had come to take our drink order. We should have just gone to the bar, but we weren't in a hurry so we thought maybe they were busy. Just as was about to give up and go to the bar someone came over and took our drink order, which was one beer and a gin and tonic. Needless to say, it took almost another 10 minutes before our drinks arrived. And no one came back to see if we wanted another round. \n\nI'm sorry, I don't mind waiting if a place is super busy, but they didn't seem to be as I watched the person that took our order chat for a few minutes with a co-worker for a while before they even started making our drinks. \n\nBeing in the service industry, I would just have appreciated some honestly about if they were too busy to do drinks for us or if it would be quicker at the bar. I will at some point go back in for food as I don't feel like this typical for their service at Timberyard, but I was pretty disappointed with having to wait 20 minutes for two basic drinks.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

But... when we asked about the restaurant, the hostess answered as if it were her parent's place.  Enthusiastic and educated on the menu, approach to food selection and the owner's philosophy.  Our server kept the same high standard.  We even had an opportunity for a quick chat with Andrew during dinner.  We could not have felt more welcome.\n\nDinner was spectacular.

With the bar in the middle of the main dining room and a large blackboard on the back wall with rotational beers and cocktails written on it. The open plan dining area is huge, tables are well spaced, offer plenty privacy but also retain an intimate feel. There is also a tranquil courtyard, a perfect space to enjoy the sun with a drink in hand.\n\nThe food menu is meticulously assembled with a dedication to local, seasonal produce and sustainability; they even filter and bottle their own water. But more than that, it has a very nordic feel (think Noma-ish) with plenty foraging, pickling, smoking and ingenious ingredient matching but also combining classic French technique with a nod to traditional Scottish dishes as well. The food most definitely delivers the promises it makes on paper. Timberyard is all about flavour, flavour and flavour. Everything you will eat will be a taste sensation, I promise. In addition to the quality of the food, the presentation is beautiful. Each dish a work of art. The drinks options are of the same high standard, offering a very comprehensive wine list, creative and unique cocktails and a good selection of beers. \n\nService is faultlessly smooth. Staff are very friendly, striking a perfect balance by being attentive without being intrusive.\n\nI think Timberyard offers pretty good value for money. Some of the larger dishes aren't inexpensive but the menu is made up of 'bites' and 'small' plates as well, offering a unique sort of tapas\/French\/Nordic fusion. Complimentary fresh bread (complete with whipped crowdie butter, celery salt and juniper infused pepper) and 'afters' of mini lemon meringue biscuit tuiles and white chocolate cylinders also adding to an already spectacular first impression.\n\nIn summary, Timberyard is an awesome place to enjoy fine dining in a relaxed, casual environment with a great buzz and without fine dining prices... mostly.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

There are many foodies in Edinburgh, there are many great, nay, wonderous restaurants in the capital. So when a new restaurant opens to a hushed hubub of excitement amongst potential diners, it both has a lot to live up to and a lot of eager customers waiting to try it out.\n\nAnd so, when I walked past the huge, giant, bright red doors on a misty Autumnal afternoon and realised *that* was Timberyard, I immediately went in to have a wee peek, and having done so, booked a table for dinner later that week.\n\nI'd heard that they have their own smoke house, and smoke their meats in house. And that the menu changes seasonally (as is so very in vogue just now). Looking at the menus pinned to the wall, I could see that they were very specialist, sumptuous but not that extensive. Four options for mains. But I did like that there were both 'Bites' and 'Smalls' as starter options. Perfect for having a taste of some of the delicious dishes without ordering just a little too much.\n\nThe restaurant itself does live up to its name - it was literally an old timber yard that has been converted. So think bare white stone walls, a hugely tall ceiling, it's almost cavernous, and it doesn't feel too big or empty or cold. Candles light the restaurant, many many candles. A small couch and rug area where you can wait for your table and enjoy a cocktail make it feel homely. The bar itself allows a drink without the need for a table too. It's fine dining cuisine, but in a laid back, homely and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe staff are all incredibly friendly and down-to-earth too. I would agree with Peter S and say that they are perhaps still settling and finding their feet, but I loved that as the waiter was clearing our plates he told us how he'd smoked the pigeon himself earlier that week, and described how he did it. That did make me smile.\n\nAs for the food itself? Well, I don't give 5 stars lightly. The bite options on the menu allowed me to try two different 'starters' -quails egg, and smoked pigeon. The quails egg dish was literally one quails egg, although it was perfectly cooked with a slightly runny yolk. And the pigeon was equally petite but equally delicious.\n\nThe main - the first on the list - venison, with red cabbage, port and parsnip. Simply outstanding. The meat was perfectly cooked - so perfect - and whilst it was a modest portion, in keeping with fine dining size, it was just right. Venison is a rich meat, and any more would have been too much.\n\nOn that note, if you are starving and like big portions, then you might leave a little hungry or having ordered all three courses, paid the price, and still not feel stuffed. But that's the point of fine dining - to enjoy the flavours and leave satisfied but not overly full. Just a fair warning for those who prefer quantity sometimes. (Or not to come after you've run a marathon, say.)\n\nDue to the slightly higher price tag, I won't be returning too soon. There are some places in Edinburgh that do very good food but at a lower price. Not as fine dining as this, but still equally as enjoyable. £17.50 for a main is more than my wallet can allow for my regular meal out. But if there were a special occasoin - family visiting, a date, a celebration - I wouldn't hestitate to recommend or come back to Timberyard.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

UHN.\n\nFull after the bite, starter and main, we oped for coffee (and a cheeky mead for me), which came with the standard fabulous little sweet bites. \n\nBetween courses we popped out into the garden to see the chickens and quails (cute and little) and decided it would be a gorgeous place to come for a cocktail on a sunny afternoon (add that to the list after a flush month!).\n\nIf I could come here once a month, I would.

I'm a smitten kitten.\n\nI arrived at Mary's on Valentine's Day around an hour before they closed. In my mind I was preparing to fight off hoards of estrogen also trying to get a chocolate fix on the Day of Commercialized Love (or on the flip side, Single's Awareness Day). When my Valentine lady-date and I stepped inside, I was pleasantly surprised to note that Mary's was surprisingly not crowded at all and that I wouldn't have to beat the crowds of girls away so I could get some sweets. Psht, more fool every other gals in town, and more ice creams for us! Despite the small quarters and few tables (there's maybe three, four, tops) we got a seat easily and procured our sweet, sweet ice creams no problem.\n\nI ended up getting a scoop of dark chocolate and something else that I can't recall anymore, writing this belatedly as I am. I do know that both my choices were delicious, the dark chocolate in particular creamy and delightful. To add points, the lady behind the counter brought out some wee Earl Gray chocolates to compliment our creams--how lovely, and they were a real treat! Very light in flavor, with definite tea notes. What a clever idea. I'd definitely fancy a sample of the Earl Gray ice cream now, having tried the chocolate. (They also sell bags of homemade chocolates too, which I dutifully took note of for future endeavors.)\n\nMary's is adorable, to put it simply. It's in a fantastic location in Grassmarket, has simple but cute decor, friendly staff, and ice cream that suits the sweetest toofs. I totally dig the fact that this is a local place that makes their own wares. I haven't tried the rest of the ice creams in town as of yet, but for now Mary's definitely is gonna be my go to if I ever need a fix in the future!","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Given I was on the Grassmarket anyway for the Jazz & Blues festival, and hot and sweaty from swing dancing in the sun, ice cream seemed like just the tonic. And it was.\n\nWhen I arrived I joined a fairly short queue, but had to wait to see the ice cream flavours due to a family being served completely obscuring it. Mary offered to take my order, but I explained I couldn't see what was on offer and waited a few more minutes before deciding. I plumped for a medium cup (£3, 3 scoops) of strawberry and elderflower vinegar (from Victoria Street's Demijohn), salted caramel and espresso. The strawberry was the standout, obviously made with real strawberries and so delicious, I sort of wish I'd just got 3 scoops of that instead! The salted caramel was okay, but a little lacking in flavour in comparison to Affogato's, and the espresso was subtle but clearly made with real coffee.\n\nSadly, after recommending it to my dancing friends, they all piled in and the queue was so long that only almond was left! Rest assured though that Mary was in the back making more, just not quick enough for the post-dancing rush.\n\nMary's Milk Bar is good, and will no doubt be deservedly busy over the summer. Affogato is better (and has a better range of flavours), but the two are sufficiently far apart that they won't prove to be competition. There's plenty space for more than one gelateria in Edinburgh.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

She suggested we try a wee bit first if we were having trouble deciding. I think there were maybe 9 flavours on the go so we decided to try 2 each. I had a wee taste of the raspberry before committing to it as it was a very bright shade of pink, not the natural colour of raspberry I'm used to seeing in gelaterias in Italy so I was worried it might be a bit plasticky. However, it was delicious, equally as tasty as what you get over there. I also had the chocolate orange which too was amazing. My fiancé pistachio and lemon and cardamom, they were good too. \n\nWe had the small tubs and it came to £5 in total which was quite reasonable. The only thing was that it was served in quite large tubs for the volume of ice-cream, making them appear half empty and that you weren't getting much ice-cream. \n\nMary's Milk Bar offers different types of ice-cream, such as dairy free and milk which is great for people with dietary requirements.

Our second visit to thaisanuk, we had intended to order green curry and pad thai both with tofu, but surprisingly they had run out of tofu, so we ordered both these dishes with vegetables instead (priced the same as with prawns, chicken or beef). The dishes arrived with a few slivers of vegetables floating in the curry and none noticeable in the pad thai.\n\nWe spoke to the waitress about the lack of vegetables, especially given the price relative to other dishes. She went away to talk to the chef and phoned the manager, and came back with an offer to remake the dishes with more vegetables. Whilst this might have been acceptable, the process had taken so much time that we had almost finished the wine and we were not in the mood to reset and start the meal again. So instead we offered to pay for one main course, which seemed reasonable given the lack of the central ingredient. There followed an indirect conversation with the manager relayed by the waitress, which ended with the comment from the manager that we would write a poor review and not return anyway, so we should just pay what we wanted.\n\nThe food had great flavour, but the bottom line for vegetarians is it is inadequate. Basically, the dishes serves are the standard base, without the addition of any meat (or tofu!) but at the same price. The manager was very disconnected from the situation, and unwilling to make things right by a small gesture. The waitress did well, though, despite the lack of support from her boss.\n\nA shame, the food has potential but issues with how the restaurant is run.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The four veggie spring rolls were soggy.\n\nGetting in touch with the kitchen didn't help. The reply was that this is the normal portion size and the chicken is cooked under high pressure so some people might think it is undercooked.

I let cheapness overrule my brain. What a mistake. \n\nFirstly, it was late lunch, and there were only a handful of people eating. That meant the servers were not exactly swept off their feet... but it took a lifetime to take my order.  In fact the lady who enticed me off the street, happened to wander by and I was able to get my meal ordered then. \n\nI ordered a selection of vegetarian tapas including patatas bravas and a aubergine and mozzarella dish. When it arrived disturbingly quickly it was apparent they all had something in common - a microwave. Yup - pre cooked deep fried potato, then zapped in some super heater, and brought out for your soggy delight. The aubergine came out felt at first lukewarm, then I discovered it was stone cold in the middle. I took a photo to demonstrate the sad presentation (I took a scoop out, but the tomato sauce \"dumped\" on the plate was preserved for it's lack of artistic merit. (servers magically appeared when I took a photo as well... I guess it isn't welcomed here to take photos of your food).\n\nI tried to get someone's attention. I failed. I looked around. Then I got bored, and, not wanting the rest of my reheated meal to get cold, I went to the bar. Then, I had 3 servers descend on me (heavens! a diner has left their seat!). I guess I got the end of the last prepacked aubergine dish, as the new plate came out piping hot and equally quickly as the original order. \n\nSo in summary, I had a poor imitation of tapas that day with dreadfully slow service, saved only by the fact it was super cheap due to the offer on that day. I won't return - the fast food nature (actually given fast food tends to be cooked fresh... I'm giving fast food a bad name here) of this restaurant makes me think you can do better by going elsewhere.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It is a gem of Edinburgh, not to mention a stop on the Ice Cream. Who knew Scotland had one?!\n\nAnyways, the place takes you back in time as the interior looks like a 1950's pharmacy (btw pharmacies back then were ice parlors rather than drug stores). The retro, pastel colors scream cozy, cute and yummy in the most tasty and adorable way. \n\nNow the ice cream, or should I say gelato. Yes, gelato so indeed not your everyday ice cream parlor. So the ice cream is famous with the most interesting and delicious and unexpected flavor combinations. She does spicy sriracha, stilton and grape, milk, whisky and ginger sorbet, thai ice team, and the list keeps going. Also, everyday is an adventure as all the flavor are rotating and even the staff don't know what tomorrow's flavors will be. But for those you like some consistency, salted caramel, dark chocolate, and milk are the 3 staples that you can pretty much always get. \n\nBut wait there's more! More than ice cream you ask? Yes! There are chocolate, truffles, and caramel you can take home. Also, adorable Mary's Milk Bar totes for the keeping. And what added to the fame, Hot chocolate floats! What?! Yes! Hot chocolate floats, and milk shakes! And you pick the ice cream. \n\nSo I could continue about the food and how great the place is, but don't take my word. This place has been featured in Buzzfeed and other cultural publishers. Not to mention, the line in summer (especially during fringe) is super longer with people continually coming back. \n\nMy recommendation, when in Edinburgh try Mary's.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I am in awe of this place after 2 scoops of heavenly gelato. This retro gelateria come truffle shop opened just last week at the foot of the Grassmarket meaning that as you step out of the door, you get a spectacular view of the Castle. I hesitate to think how many cones will lose their crown as the soon to be deprived consumer stops to gawp at the view, tilts their hand a little too far and *smack* scoop hits the floor!  There was a selection of about 8 flavours when I was there this afternoon. Apparently the flavours will be rotated and it would seem that Mary herself is regularly tweeting about what you might expect to find in her freezer of a day. I had dairy free lemon and cardamom, remarkably creamy for dairy- (and apparently fat-!) free and utterly delicious with both flavours subtle yet immediately apparent. I also had a scoop of espresso icecream which again was creamily delicious and tasted of proper coffee. Possibly the most realistic coffee icecream I've ever had - none of that 'coffee flavour' guff - this is defo the real thing! From the blackboard in the shw I also saw that she serves affogate with Freeman's coffee... I wonder if it's overkill to ask for an espresso over espresso icecream!? The other flavours available the day I visited were vanilla, mint choc chip (receiving vocal high praise from other customers), vanilla, belgian chocolate and rice pudding. She also  had banana and mago and banana and pineapple which were both dairy free - making 3 dairy free! In a milk bar! Genius. Not only is it delicious, but great value too. At the time of writing, Mary is charging £2 for the first scoop and 50p for each additional one thereafter. I will be back again and again until i've tried them all. More than once!

However, because of this, I suspect that MMB will have some growing pains (much to our delight, they are doing really good business! I hope she is able to expand to other parts of town soon, too!!!). If you are stopping by at the weekend, please note that the closing hours are sharp-- they begin curtailing the line before they close in order to serve those in line by closing time. Weekend afternoon and evenings are the busiest and while Mary herself may wonder \"why everyone comes just before closing time\", she may also discover that her fans would definitely be interested in a gelato cone at 6pm\nor afterwards, and I would venture to say well into the evening hours on a weekend (and dare I recommend it,? even after a meal until 10pm!). \n\nSo, to review what many others have already said:\n1) this is real gelato. GOOD ingredients, fresh taste, thoughtful, artful pairings, unique flavours, evocative of Italy, Spain, or France with the decoration of a 1948 milk bar in the US. \n2) she could easily charge 1.5 times to twice what her gelatos retail for and we would all still pay for it because it is a delightful treat (at the time of this writing a single scoop of gelato was £2).\n3) cash only, so make sure you go to the cashpoint before dropping in, otherwise you'll be disappointed and will probably hold up the queue\n4) milkshakes, hot chocolates, inventive flavours, warm interior, great Castle view. It is wonderful\n5) I'm partial to the ever-present dark chocolate but the creative flavours are always so so good. Try flavours with cheese in them or pear. You won't regret it. \n\nKeep up the great work!!! Before MMB, I have to say that the rest of the gelato in Edinburgh simply wasn't up to snuff. ¡Olé!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Scottish ice cream? Overly sweet and creamy and overly priced tiny scoop of ice cream, right? In this case, wrong. \n\nMary's milk bar has a fantastic location in the lively Grassmarket overlooking the castle. It's a wee place, rather unassuming from the exterior, but go inside and you may find good ice cream...\n\nThere weren't many flavours to choose from. Funnily enough this in itself made me hopeful. It's better to excel at a few high-quality quality products rather than excessively piling up flavours.  \n\nI opted for a small tub of the spiced stewed plums sorbet and the pistachio flavour. The friendly lady working there (perhaps Mary?) was friendly and let me try a few flavours as I was having a hard time deciding. I judge good ice cream based on pistachio, a classic. The portion size was quite generous, reminiscent of the portion sizes in Italy. The spiced stewed plums was absolutely divine. The pistachio was tasty but slightly let down by the high milk content, it could have done with being a bit nuttier\/richer.  \n\nI will be back to sample other flavours. \n\nOverall, tasty ice cream in a convenient location, good value for good quality.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Ice cream places are popping up all over Edinburgh - and Mary's Milk Bar is the newest that I know of.\n\nIt popped up on my radar after I saw several Yelpers checking in here during the sunny evenings and weekend days we've been having. And then a review. And then another. So when the Jazz Festival was on in the Grassmarket last weekend, I popped in here myself to see what the frozen fuss was about.\n\nIt's a cute wee place, and feels very homely. Small, with a few tables, and a small freezer counter, it still serves up around 8 different flavours that are quite unusual. When I was in there was a dairy free orange and vinegar (apparently very good), and a few others I can't remember. I opted for the pistachio to have as an affogato (served with a shot of espresso).\n\nNow, my only disappointment was that my two friends each got a cone with two scoops. The scoops were HUGE and it cost them £3. My affogato was also £3 so I thought I'd get one scoop in a cup with an espresso shot. Instead I got a smidgen of ice cream - a mere smear on the inside of a coffee cup. Not a whole scoop. Sad face. I ended up eating some of my friends ice cream off their cone.\n\nSo, the affogato isn't the way to go. Hell, buy a two scoop cone and then an espresso shot and you'll be happier. As the two scoop cones are huge and delicious and just mmm.\n\nI'm not sure if it was Mary serving us herself. There was a lovely, slightly quiet but sweet girl and a peppy guy behind the counter. Despite that it was roasting outside, and a steady stream of customers who were diminishing ice cream supplies very quickly, they didn't stop smiling and the queue went down quickly.\n\nMy only worry and wonder is what will happen to all these ice cream places when our 30 days of annual sunshine disappears? I'd hope it becomes a cosy spot to sit and is warm inside, to enjoy some ice cream, when winter descends. Because, as always, without fail every year, winter is coming...","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Baby needs calcium, right?\n\nSo, when I had a friend staying in town who wanted to meet up somewhere central, I immediately suggested Mary's. I'd read that it was small but didn't comprehend that it was two tables and one additional seating area small. They also don't appear to have a toilet (this falls into the pregnancy\/relevant category for me).\n\nI didn't expect in a million years that it would be busy, though. I mean, it's November, right?  Wrong. It was heaving. I walked in and there were loads of people milling about and no clear place to stand if you wanted to order vs if you had ordered and were just waiting to pay or for your drink. I just took a guess and stationed myself in front of the gelato and hoped for the best. Fortunately I'm pushy but if I wasn't I could easily have been overlooked as others came in and, like me, hovered around the gelato flavours.\n\nAfter a quick try of the spiced pumpkin (which I think used freshly ground spices as opposed to pre-ground ones, so mega points for that), I opted against my normal judgement and selected the salted caramel to accompany it.  Should have gone with the chocolate.\n\nThe salted caramel was a major letdown for me. It contained one large (think two peas) hunk of tasty caramel, but the rest of the scoop was, to the best of my awareness, caramel-free. Not only was it caramel free, it was also essentially flavourless. I would have expected a vanilla but no, I think it's more likely that this is their \"milk\" flavour, which was not only flavourless but was also rather icy and not very creamy.  \n\nAs I was paying, a guide brought a tour group into the shop.  Certainly not Mary's fault at all but the group were completely disorganised and there were FAR too many of them to cram into such a small place. Really poor form of that guide. If this is a common occurrence, I would think Mary might want to institute a system similar to the grocery stores near schools in order to ensure that the whole shop doesn't descend into chaos on their arrival.","useful":7,"funny":4,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

Or \"Milk\"... yeah, it's just a kinda fancy vanilla, but you FEEL cooler ordering it.\n\nIt's a cute as a button shop that is always packed, rain or shine, serves up delicious hot chocolate and equally delicious ice cream... sometimes in a donkey bowl (ask... just ask). \n\nIt's charming, it's quirky, it's a shop full of dairy.\nCase.

Of all places, this just happened to be my first stop and what a pleasant surprise it was. Despite the cold weather and rain, my friends that were studying abroad in Edinburgh and I came by this small shop and were greeted with huge smiles. The two women ran us through every single flavor, which was incredible! After a while of thinking, I settled on the rose water with chocolate and puréed steamed pear gelatos. I was blown away by the pear flavor because it was unlike anything I had ever had before. I still believe it was the most unique ice cream\/gelato flavor I have had. The rose water flavor wasn't as spectacular, but it had small chunks of chocolate that were hand made the previous nights by one of the women behind the counter. They had multiple types of chocolate toppings that could be added that were also hand made! As we waited for our scoops, we were asked to try some of the new chocolates she had experimented with which was fantastic. I am not sure if we would have gotten the same incredible service if it were not an empty store. The cold weather clearly had steered people away and I feel they really missed out.

Not only is it s beautiful little shop, but it has the loveliest and friendliest staff ever and is home to Edinburghs Best Ice Cream. \n\nMy family is Italian and my grandad opened up an ice cream factory and had a fleet of ice cream vans that brightened everyone's day. Having that in your blood assures one thing: you don't half give a damn about the quality of ice cream you shovel in your face!! Mary's is literally my favourite place to go, so much so that when my grandad died, I brought a brick of her ice cream for the close family to share and reminisce over. Well, Ben & Jerry were just never going to be respected, right!! Now my whole family are fans and are delighted to know someone local is doing such a killer job of running this town :)\n\nTop tips: go early on Friday for DONUT FRIDAY! That's an artisan donut sliced in half and your favourite scoop in the middle. Best sandwich ever! I personally recommend the coffee ice cream for this combo - you can't get any more Twin Peaks than that  \n\nHot Chocolate Floats are insanely good, but can be challenging to consume in one sitting inside. If you get it in a To Go cup, you'll be able to take it away and enjoy the rest of that sweet lava whilst having a lovely stroll around the area. \n\nALSO she does awesome chocolate truffles which are a real treat, and she's just launched her line of chocolate bars. They are to die for  flavour changes every week, and she's a taste wizard so you can guarantee I will be buying as many as I can before she sells out. \n\nFYI, this place is super popular, so for the biggest selection of flavours go earlier on.

BUT I think we must have waited about 10 minutes before they came over asking for our order...... we hadn't even been asked up until this point if we would like drinks, which we certainly did. Then after ordering there was a dreadful wait for these much desired drinks to arrive, which was rather infuriating.\n\nOn to the food, it was good. It is nothing spectacular and for the price I think it is a good deal for a quick and tasty meal, but it is nothing I couldn't make at home. My friend decided to be healthy and have a 'light option' of flatbread pizza with salad. I was surprised at the size, it was really rather small considering I had a whole pizza for the same price, and she was rather disappointed with the unadventurous small salad. \n\nThen came the waiting..... again. This time to pay. We had to call someone over after waiting with the card on the table for 10 or 15 minutes. Then not only had we been waiting, but as the staff seem a little discombobulated a young girl came over expecting us to pay AGAIN.\n\nSo.... the overall verdict. Food is tasty, much what I expected.

It is one of the pubs that is busier on Wednesday afternoon than Saturday evening. Actually to be honest it's about the same because it's exactly the same people in there all the time. It could easily be the scene from a sitcom with a load of old boys propping up the bar, each with their own little quirk. Going in there quite a bit over the past year I have got to know them and they are all nice lads but if I were just popping in whilst passing I would feel very out of place. \n\nThe beers are exactly what you'd expect in this sort of place. The have a few lagers and a few ales on tap but nothing special. The only thing notable as far as drinks go is that a bottle of Bulmers only costs £2.70, cheaper than most of the student bars. \n\nThere is a jukebox, but it is rarely turned on. Instead the bar staff opt for their laptops attached to the speakers as then they can put on old the old classics that the regulars seem to love. There is also a pool table, and if you get chatting to a few of the old boys a game or 2 invariably follows. As well as this they have a free dart board, which is good at first, but becomes increasingly frustrating the more drinks you have (and with my flatmate's accuracy drastically shortening the life expectancy of anyone in the near vicinity).\n\nIt is a nice little pub but nothing special and unless you are a regular or know them it can feel a little intimidating, but they are friendly old bods so give it a chance.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The yacht has been perfectly preserved, and as a visitor you will have access to every deck (if not the actual cabins, which are shielded by glass panes). To get the best out of your visit I definitely recommend the audio guide, which provides a lot of information not otherwise available in any form on the yacht itself.\n\nThe Britannia experience will indeed provide an accurate representation of what life must have been like for the Queen, her relatives and her staff on trips overseas - the yacht was in use for more than 40 years, traveling more than 1,000,000 miles. The change to another yacht is understandable, considering the quaintness of much of the furniture and decor. Which actually enhances your visit.\n\nYou can take photos anywhere on the yacht, which I consider a big plus. A visit doesn't come cheap though - UKP 14.00 for an adult single ticket. \n\nOpening times: January, February, March, November, December*  10.00am  3.30pm\nApril, May, June, July, August, September  9.30am  4.30pm\nOctober  9.30am  4.00pm.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Some of the most interesting parts of the liner are the bedrooms where you can actually see the rooms that the Royal Family slept as they sailed around the world and the huge dining room. I found it wonderfully interesting to get to know the royal family a bit more as I did not know who many of them were.\n\n\n There are many facts that I wont list here but you will enjoy picking up as there really is a lot to learn about from this ship.

Nuestra visita al antiguo yate de la familia real británica fue, contra toda intuición, una de las cosas más amenas que hicimos en toda nuestra visita a Edimburgo, y eso que hicimos muchas.\n\nEl yate está en un puerto que está a una buena distancia del centro de Edimburgo; por suerte hay un autobús que te lleva hasta allí directamente desde el propio centro. La entrada se hace a través de un centro comercial de un barrio que, no sé si sería por ser portuario o porque el día estaba oscuro, daba algo de miedito; el interior del centro comercial daba aún más.\n\nLa cola era larga y estaba básicamente conformada por personas mayores, que suelen ser las más favorables a estas jefaturas de estado hereditarias que a nosotros se nos hacen un tanto alienígenas (suerte que somos la República de España). El personal era encantador, muy sonriente, y con la entrada te dejan la audioguía que, sinceramente, en este caso es para escuchársela entera porque está poblada de anecdatos sobre aquella familia real muy curiosos. Además, como ves tanto las zonas públicas como las privadas, tanto las de pasajeros como las de marineros, aprendes un montón de cosas sobre el arte de navegar y sobre el de vivir como reyes en un enorme ataúd que surca las olas.\n\nLa cafetería del barco, justo encima de la zona de la familia real, es una pasada, tanto de calidad como de servicio. Ahora bien, te lo cobran a precio de oro.\n\nCuando estuvimos nosotros tenían camuflados por el barco un montón de perros de peluche disfrazados; si contabas el número total de ellos que había, entrabas en el sorteo de un oso de peluche vestido de marinero, lo cual provocaba disonancia cognitiva porque contabas perros pero te llevabas un oso.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The style is elegance and grace with a country fill not ostentatious or overly regal.  \nIf I remember correctly the first double bed to be placed aboard the yacht was for Charles and Diana's honeymoon.  \n\nThe Sun lounge favoured by the Queen was informal and the Royal family enjoyed breakfast and afternoon tea here.

Flat whites are always double shots, but whatever. That can just be a concession so you don't get questions from confused people who just want a weaker flat white while not angering the annoying nitpickers like myself who expect a flat white to be one thing and one thing only. I asked what size cup he uses, just as a precautionary measure, and the size of a double was a latte cup. Even the \"single flat white\" was bigger than the \"standard size\" of a FW. Fine.

The cafe also has plenty of knick knacks on sale, from moustaches for your cupcakes to tat for your wall (or as the OH calls it 'Sara things') which I approve of. \n\nAs the OH isn't the smallest of guys we were a bit cramped on one of the middle tables so a bit more space would be nice but you can't have everything...*sigh*","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I don't have a particularly sweet tooth but they have a huge range of tempting cakes and muffins.  Further, just about everything on the menu is made from ethical sources and its a strong advocator of Fairtrade produce.  \nI had the scrambled eggs on toast which had herbs mixed in with it and tasted delicious.  The service was friendly but everyone at the counter did seem to be waiting for quite a while.  Nevertheless, the food is certainly worth the wait and their lunchtime menu has plenty of tasty-looking and healthy Mediterranean options like olives with feta cheese and cured meat.  \nIf this isn't enough they also do open mic and even poetry events which they advertise inside.

We'd chosen to visit this part of town to check out the antique stores and happened upon Vintage and Reclaimed.  The owner explained that the furniture is all new, but his standard stock is made from reclaimed timbers which gives it a fantastic look.\n\nHe also stocks furniture made by someone down south (I think??) which has a more finished look to it and is also gorgeous.  \n\nThe best part about this place is that they are willing to make what you want to size.  This means that if you fall in love with a piece of furniture they have on the shop floor and devastatingly discover that it won't fit in your house, not a problem!  They will make one of the size and colour which you like.  \n\nOn top of this, the prices are SO reasonable.  Seriously.  The Man and I are looking for a massive wardrobe and the one we found here was a good £700+ cheaper than any other one we liked.  \n\nAfter we left here we visited the aforementioned antique stores but just kept saying \"it's not as good as Vintage and Reclaimed\" so we gave up and decided that once the building work is done, we will scrape together our pennies and spend them all here.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

So when Yelp announced it was having dinner at Mark Greenaway last month, I jumped at the chance having missed out on two opportunities previously and hearing so many good things about it and wondering if he really would love up to the standard displayed on tv.\n\nWhen I arrived I was greeted by a handsome well-suited young man who took my coat and showed me to my seat. I immediately liked the place and appreciated the mood created by the decor, colour of paintwork, lighting and music. \n\nWe were treated to a wine tasting downstairs in what was the former bank's vault but is now the wine cellar. After six generous samples from which we could choose one to accompany our meal and learning a bit about each we giggled our way back upstairs and even got lost on the way (there are a few doors). What an excellent way to start off a dinner!\n\nI opted for the Market Menu - 3 courses for £20 and phenomenal value for money it was! To start, we were presented with a lovely cute aperitif which I wasn't expecting. At this point I was rather merry from the wine tasting and wolfed it down without paying attention to what it was(sorry) but it was goooood and that is the main thing! \n\nMy chosen starter was Scottish Mushroom Veloute - Roasted Scottish Mushrooms, Tarragon, Truffle and Raviolo. When it was placed in front of me, to begin with all I could see was sliced mushroom topped with 1 ravioli in the middle of a very large dish and then I saw everyone elses significantly bigger alternative starters, I thought I had been had but then came my pouring sauce. So I discovered that Veloute means soup (new thing learnt for the day, done!) and this was a wonderfully delicious, satisfying mushroom soup with a twist.\n\nFor my main I opted for 11 Hour Slow Roasted Clash Farm Belly - Pomme Purée, Savoy Cabbage, Toffee Apple Jus: a-m-a-z-i-n-g! It was beautifully presented and the combination of flavours complimented each other superbly. \n\nDessert for me was Broken Chocolate Tart - Custard Jelly, Frozen Cookies, Crème Fraiche Parfait, Salted Caramel and kumquat Purée and this blew me away. Each chocolatey thing was of a different shape, size, flavour and texture; accompanied by fruity flavoured purees and popping candy - wow! On my first bite I rolled all the way back in my seat and savoured every single mouthful with a loving tenderness I have never given to food before and I was sorry to see it gone, hoping more would appear on my plate. This for me was a work of art.  \n\nWow! This was a sensory experience I could never have imagined and unlike anything I have had before. The staff were so attentive to every detail, with brilliant knowledge - remembering every ingredient on the plate and making suggestions for how the dish could be eaten as recommended by chef. Also one noticed I had taken photos of my food and asked if I wanted her to wait whilst I took more before setting down additional plates. If I had been on my own in this restaurant I probably would have got carried away and photographed my dishes from a lot more angles - 'work it, work it baby'. It was wonderful to experience staff so passionate about their work!\n\nThe next day I raved about the place to everyone I saw! I am most definately coming back here!","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

I've been meaning to try his fine dining for a while now, after reading so many good reviews and this was the perfect opportunity to sample some of his fine dining at an affordable price.\nWe had booked a table for 7.30 pm and when we arrived, the lovely lady at the reception took us to our table, which was a nice corner table. We were quite surprised that the restaurant was so quiet, but I guess it is mid term holiday this week, and it was a Tuesday.  I have to admit that I felt a bit self conscious as we were the only ones in the room but our hostess was lovely and chatty.\nWe ordered our food and as we had both opted for the pork as a main and were a bit uncertain about the wine, we were recommended a reasonably priced Pinot Grigio. \nAfter a very short wait, we were brought a delicious pea and mint amuse-bouche.  I love when restaurants do that.  It's very common in France but you only seem to get it in fine dining places in Scotland. That was certainly a lovely start to the meal.\nFor starter, G had gone for the terrine and after hesitating all day between the cullen skink and the ravioli, I opted for the ravioli.  I do love cullen skink but this was too good an opportunity not to try that delicious sounding dish! Both starter plates looked very pretty and were a pleasure to the palate.\nThe main course then arrived.  I had been looking forward to that slow cooked pork all day and it certainly looked as pretty as it tasted!  The crackling is just soooo good with a little bit of salt. Divine! Now, I did say on twitter that I would have liked the texture of cooked apple with it, but that's probably just because I'm French!  The dish is fantastic and the puree and the jus were very delicate and delicious.  \nOur waitress was very attentive and the service was quick. We were offered pudding but didn't opt for it as we were feeling full and were left to finish our bottle of wine.\nI haven't mentioned that the restaurant is nicely and tastefully decorated, the lighting is quite low, which make a pleasant and intimate atmosphere, and I did like the background music, which was jazzy enough to create an atmosphere but not overpowering at all.\nI can't wait to go back, and will happily save some pennies to be able to afford the normal price!\nAlso, I haven't found out how to add pictures to a review but I have posted the pictures to the restaurant's profile so everybody can admire the faultless presentation.\nHats off Mr Greenaway, and thank you for partnering with Yelp!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

The first thing that struck me was how boring the items were. See, a lot of places like this, it's truffle this, stone fruit that (not peaches or plums, no, that's too everyday), kumquats, some kind of root you've never heard of - you know, stuff that you don't really have in your larder and couldn't get anyway, and stuff that would intimidate or put off your pickier friends.\n\nNot so, here! They don't rely on that to make the meal incredible, just really sharp execution, plating, and service. I had a stock (don't call it a bone broth, and they didn't either) as a course that was super well executed but to make it extra fun it was infused at the table using a balance brewer to draw the broth through some fresh herbs.\n\nLike everything was really, really incredible, just spectacular - but it was all in the execution. It wasn't even particularly complicated execution, either - like, sous vides with proper finishes, fluid gels, that sort of thing. Stuff a sufficiently motivated home cook can pull off.\n\nBut the real cap was when I asked if any of their desserts traveled well, because my friend's wife was at home sick with the child, and I wanted to share some of this wonderful meal with her.\n\nOur server frowned worriedly and said, \"I'll go ask chef.\"\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, as we were wrapping up, he returned with a plastic container.\n\nThis wasn't a typical takeaway container - it was obviously a prep container, with some tape residue still evident. I don't know what they dumped out to accommodate our unreasonable request, but I do know that even though they aren't a takeaway place, they plated one of their desserts beautifully in a prep container just to make our experience that much better.\n\nWithout the service, this would have been one of my favorite meals. I cannot believe that you can deliver a restaurant experience this excellent where I'd feel comfortable taking the pickiest, most conservative eaters I know. But for them to obviously do something they don't, and not even try to demur, just accommodate us?\n\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. I rave about this place.

And I am not just talking about the review that follows, but I've noticed a trend of contrary reviews. That's ok, I try to keep myself unbiased as best I can, and to that regard, I award 4 stars, a drop from 5. \n\n*audible gasp from the audience*\n\nThere are reasons, oh yes there is, and I still regard MG as some sort of culinary god. But, it's a new menu, and I think it needs to get of it's training wheels. Flavours-wise don't feel quite together yet. Presentation, as always, flawless. Service struggled with a table of 18, but was pleasant throughout, but time between courses was quite long, but I put that down to the sheer effort in presentation, however glasses were rarely empty (although my other half did observe as he didn't drink wine, he wasn't offered anything else to drink bar water). I came away with the same satisfied feeling as before and did have a fabulous evening, but perhaps with less wow involved. \n\nSo apart from time, the amuse bouche - celeriac (yum) and the flavour in the espuma packed a punch, but not quite sure red amaranth and a very surprisingly solid hazelnut matched in either flavour or texture. \n\nStarter: crab cannelloni and smoked cauliflower custard. Presentation was... just .... awesome. An inspirational dish. But... it was so cold there were ice crystals inside the cannelloni (which with the spinach butter acting as the pasta, it made sense to be so cold) which I didn't particularly enjoy. The display of releasing the applewood smoke and the flavours in the smoked cauliflower custard was fantastic and surpassed the cannelloni itself. \n\nFor my main, I went for the hake. I will note, which I hadn't noticed on my previous visit, that there is a major lack of vegetarian meals - starter, yes, but not main course, which I do find curious. In that manner, I am of course, biased. The hake was beautifully cooked, and I do recommend that the broth is added, it was delicious. The purple potato mash was the best item on the plate (with a nod to Bodger and Badger, I do love me some mashed potato) - the flavour in the potato were beautifully captured. I did notice that mashed potato was a popular theme in the dishes around me as well. Again, I am mesmerised by the detail in the dish in front of me. \n\nFinally, as I couldn't really say no (similar to last time really) to desert and this time, went for the broken lemon tart. That was a fun looking dish! It reminded my (looks-wise, not flavour) of Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts. The lemon tart pieces were fab, and shortbread base, packed full of buttery goodness. I *think* there was a lemon ice cream - that didn't really stand out for me, flavours were too close to the tart to be discernible - and coconut jelly, which to be honest, had attracted me to the dish in the first place - but it was utterly lacking in flavour - definitely felt like a dud. A week on though, the sharpness of the lemon tart sticks more in my mind. And I am not thinking about the fact I ate jelly for the first time in a long time (veggie no no, I am a bad girl as i didn't check for gelatine). \n\nAnyway, overall, if you went to MG for a beautifully presented meal, which is executed flawlessly, you won't be sorry. And I suspect, that if I returned in a few months time, or longer, that the meal I had tonight will have changed and improved. New babies need to learn to crawl, and this menu is no different.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

From his words at the Foodies Christmas Fair to his updates on twitter he was giving nothing away. So clandestine was this becoming that a head chef from another restaurants comment on twitter that he looked forward to having Mark as a neighbour lead to the rumour he was off to the Royal Mile. Then, just two weeks ago, he announced his new location as 67 North Castle Street the site of a former Italian Restaurant and once upon a time an RBS branch.\n\nI was delighted to have a reason for booking for opening weekend, as Stephs parents are in town for their birthday weekend and we couldn't think of anywhere we would rather take them. So roughly 3 minutes after the announcement of the new restaurant was made I had my reservation request sent. Roll on two weeks and last night was the night I've been waiting for, all the more eagerly after such positive comments from those who attended the launch party and Yelpers Jackie.G and Claire.L who were there for opening night.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you upon entering in that all of the staff have stayed with Mark, infant he confirmed later he didn't lose any of his staff despite being closed for 7 weeks. Once seated you soon see that Mark and his team have been able to recreate the wonderful ambiance the had at Piccardy Place. To the menu and from the à la carte it was good to see he has kept the favourites while also introducing something new to lift the menu further.\n\n\nOnce we had ordered, the sommelier Loic who we have gotten to know was kind enough to show us his new wine vault, with this having been an RBS the original vault in the basement remains. Given how little time they have has to prepare its amazing how much they have achieved. The wood work and the style they have given this room is really impressive. Loic explained that they intend to further develop the vault and diner will be able to select their wines with an illustrated world map on the wall providing further details. Loic will also be on hand advising and giving diners tasting samples of suggested pairing wines.\n\n\nAs soon as we sat down we were presented with our amuse bouchée, as espuma on f shallots. Can't such much about this other than it was delicious. Slight sweetness with earthy undertones it was a great way to start our meal.\n\n\nFor my starter I chose the pave of pigs cheek, served with warm apple jelly, apple purée a flavoured meringue, the pave is wrapped in beetroot carpaccio. This is a dish which has gone through a few developments since I first had it at the Great British Menu party and its only gotten better. The balance of the deep flavour of the cheek with apple and beetroot is superb. It's a dish I would happily order again and again.\n\n\nFor my main I went for the tasting of lamb. Succulent tender lamb, deep jus, aromatic rosemary, buttery mash and earthy brussel sprouts.......delicious! The lamb came three ways, a loin chop, a piece of filet and some leg. The flavour of the lamb was just incredible, the seasoning brought out the taste as much as Amy producer could hope for.\n\n\nTo finish I decided to revisit a favourite of mine the broken citrus tarte. This dish simply put is a work of art in appearance and just as tasty. The zing of the parfait is beautifully matched by the coconut, watermelon cubes clean the palate and the pistachio purée adds another dimension when combined. After dinner Loic was also kind enough to take me back to the vault and give me a sample of the most incredible muscat I have ever tasted, larger quantities will be required when my dry January has finished.\n\nAll in all the meal was superb, Stephs parents were delighted and then even more so when they had a good ten minute chat with the man himself Mr Greenaway. Mark is such a friendly guy and willingness to chat to customers at the end of a service does him great credit. With the excitement that has surrounded this opening I can say the product more than lives up the hype. Undoubtedly they have a lot of work to do but with Marks inventive cooking and the team he has around him I am confident this new venture will be a massive success.\n\nRestaurant Mark Greenaway comes highly JD Recommended!","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It was bizarre, but in a good way!\n\nI had the Ham hough terrine to start, which was served with hazelnut mayo, red wine jelly, and toast.  If you can imagine all of these things but miniaturised, and arranged at pleasing angles around the plate, you might have some idea of what it looked like.  In fact, there is a helpful photo here on Yelp that someone has added, so don't even listen to me, check it out! The terrine was delicious and the red wine jelly and hazelnut mayo out of this world. This guy really knows how to combine flavours. \n\nZoe had the Cullen Skink, which, as she said was a 'reconstructed' version of the classic dish, a piece of smoked haddock on a slice of potato, served with the actual soup in a small jug to pour around the solids. It also had a couple of little leeks with baby onions on top and it looked a real treat. Zoe though it very tasty, although the soup could have been a little warmer.\n\nWe both had the 11-hour slow roast pork belly, which was served with spiced pork fillet, pomme puree and mini apple cubes! It was the finest port belly I have ever tasted, beautifully presented (again, see the photo already posted by someone else), and incredibly succulent, as you would expect. The fillet was incredibly tender, and delicately spiced. The pomme puree was the tastiest mashed potato I have ever had, it was just so incredibly buttery!\n\nThis was an example of truly refined fine dining, and my words do not really do it justice. This truly was an experience to remember, although the regular prices make it prohibitively expensive to most of us.

OMG it was beautiful and everything I had been waiting less than patiently for! \n\nI had never visited Librizzis, the previous incarnation of the site but I was uber excited that Mark was finally opening again. I wanted to pork out on piggy so badly and on a snowy Edinburgh night I got my wish.\n\nThis was opening night but things ran smoothly with lovely, attentive staff. The restaurant has a different layout to no12 Picardy Place but the teal walls, dark stained wooden floors and gorgeous windows gave the restaurant a lovely intimate atmosphere (which clearly worked on one couple who snogged constantly between courses). The downstairs will be getting worked on with awesome plans afoot for the private dining room :-)\n\nLoic the sommelier was fab, fabulous knowledge and recommendations and the wine cellar is awesome. Way back in the day, the building was a bank (RBS) and now Loic has commandeered the former bank vault for a wine cellar. We visited and tried a gorgeous pinot noir (v light with almost a slight edge of white citrus) but Jackie G wasn't quite ready to go full red and we ended up sharing a gorgeously refreshing sauvignon semillion. \n\nBeing the generally depressing month January is, we were both set on pud before we arrived so we ordered mains and pud, rather than 3 courses which was just enough. A shallot amuse bouche with basil oil was brought for us to have and it was lovely. Forming and warmed, it was literally tantalising our taste buds for what was to come. Yep, the pork belly is still on the menu and is my idea of pig heaven! I could have tried something else but being so fat phobic about meat, having pork belly which melts in the mouth is simply amazing and with Mark out of the scene for a couple of months, I would have killed for this dish. Combined with the caramel apple jus, savoy cabbage, apple cubes and pomme puree, I was literally in pig heaven! I had tried some of Jackie G's Aberdeen angus and it was gorgeous! Big slab of meat, cute little potato croquettes and gorgeously sticky and meaty bone marrow, complete with a lovely rich bone marrow gravy - yum!\n\nWe did do our plates justice but had a bit of a break to re-group before plunging into the dessert menu. I had the jam jar (pic posted) and as the snow kept coming down, it wad the perfect comfort food on a cold night. Plum compote, custard foam and rice pudding, it was just so yummy. A pear sorbet presented on the jar lid with a caramelised plum strip on top was gorgeous! Jackie went for the chocolate torte which was fab - sticky ginger drops, kumquat, dark chocolate and what tasted like space dust lite version (which buzzed nicely in the mouth) was fab too! \n\nLoic came over after we discussed having digestives. A gorgeous Aussie dessert wine was provided for us to sample which Jackie went for and after spying port, I couldn't resist. Our drinks and a chat with Mark and Nicola rounded off a fabulous night. I'll definitely be back v soon - food was gorgeous and I have to say, OMG, still stands for (breathy voice) Oh Mark Greenaway...","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Having tried and loved some of the pork belly from their stand at the Foodies festival a few weeks ago, I was expecting good things and I wasn't disappointed. \n\nThis was my first experience of deconstructed food, and it was a little confusing at times, but so delicious that my confusion soon evaporated in a haze of contentment. I had crab cannelloni as a starter which came balanced over a bowl of cauliflower custard and applewood smoke. Like every part of this meal the presentation was beautiful. I don't think I've ever eaten such an artistically constructed meal. Pretty as it was, I was a little unsure what to to do with my starter but fortunately the helpful waiting staff were there to explain the recommended method of eating it. \n\nI went for the duck as a main course which was more straightforward than the crab. Unfortunately I can't remember the exact combination of ingredients that made up the dish but I haven't forgotten how good it was. A plate of inspiration that i wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any meat eater. \n\nI had the jam jar as a dessert which consists of four plum-orientated components. This included rice pudding (as soon as I saw this a childhood nostalgia trip kicked in and I was sold) and some of the best ice cream I've ever tasted.\n\nFrom start to finish the food was excellent. Delicate flavours combined with flare and imagination. The service was good without being embarrassingly formal (my glass was getting topped up before I even noticed it needed it). My only slight niggle (and it's very slight) was that the menu was a little too weighted on the side of quality over quantity. I was still hungry at the end of a three course meal but the food was so good that this isn't a major complaint. I'm looking forward to going back for more.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Without a doubt, the best eating experience I've had in my life. Mark Greenaway is a fantastic chef and his refreshingly contemporary menu definitely reflects this. \n\nI was asked from my lovely boyfriend what I'd like for my birthday, and all I could think of was a nice meal out, and he told me to book the place of my choice. I wonder if he meant that 100%, but I took it upon myself to book a table for the opening weekend of Mark Greenaway's spectacular new restaurant on 69 North Castle Street. We headed in this evening a bit earlier (damn you Edinburgh road works!), but made it in plenty of time. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, which by the way is absolutely beautiful; with it's high chandelier, intimate colour choices and exquisitely laid tables, our coats were taken by the lovely host and we were seated next to the window; how lovely and romantic considering it was snowing! The staff in here are the best at their job, from setting tables, to offering drinks, to the waitress who brought our courses to us and explained how each course was made and how Mark suggests you eat it. Our orders were taken, our wine was poured, and Colin and I immediately began chatting about our love for the place. \n\nOur aperitifs were brought out; with a beautiful shallot amuse bouche, which were thoroughly enjoyed. For my starter I ordered the crab cannelloni with smoked cauliflower custard, lemon pearls, herb butter, baby coriander and beetroot mayo, and Colin ordered the red wine risotto with hen egg. Oh God, you think you've tasted good crab before, but you've not until you've been here. The way Mark makes it it's in 2 different parts of the dish, and thought most people would eat from the top of a dish to the bottom, Mark suggests you try both simultaneously. I did, and I enjoyed. Thoroughly! \n\nOur wonderful waiting staff cleared the table, before our main courses were brought to the table. Colin had the pan roasted hake fillet, with a lobster tortellini, purple mash, fennel and dill puree and pumpkin, and I ordered the 11 hour slow roasted pork belly, with spiced fillet, pomme puree, savoy cabbage and toffee apple jus. This is without a doubt the best meal I've ever eaten. The pork was so tender and beautifully cooked, whilst the beautiful fat crackling on top was crisp and so tasty. The spiced fillet was cooked medium rare and was exquisite and everything on the plate just complimented each other so well.\n\nIf all that wasn't enough, for desserts I had the broken lemon tart, with yuzu parfait, frozen shortbread, pistachio puree, compact watermelon and coconut jelly, and Colin had the chocolate fondant. I'm not a dessert eater normally, but wow. WOW. Exquisite.\n\nMust make a note of how great our wine was. I'm positive it was an Australian rosé but I'm not 100%. Wonderful though, so crispy and tangy but fruity at the same time.\n\nI had to ask our waiter to give compliments to the chef, something I've never done, because I was so impressed. Mark is an outstanding chef, and I will most definitely be back here again and again.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Since the Christamas menu hadn't much appealed to us, we opted for ordering off the a la carte.\n\nThe atmosphere is small yet clean crisp tables and quiet conversations by candlelit make the space work.  Staff were welcoming upon our entrance and I liked the meticulously organised bar on view.  It was a cute gesture to have personalised cards to our party on the table waiting for us.\n\nWe were started off with some Champagne then came the veloute.  It had a nice texture of crisp garnish to the foam of the body and a vibrant contrast of colors.  But other than that, it was an average veloute.      \n\nThe scallop starter consisted of a raw scallop & an already cooked one served separately on a bamboo serving tray.  I could see the sear on the outside of the cooked scallop was perfectly done but the inside was ever so slightly under.  Minimal seasoning meant a clean aftertaste but the one cooked item of the dish should have been perfectly cooked.  One raw scallop, diced and presented within its shell was the layout I had to pour hot dashi into.  This provided for the theatrical component of the night, as the sizzle of bonito flakes reacted to the hot liquid, and dry ice wispily escaped through the strategically placed river stones.  It was cute, but nothing new.  Scallops were fresh combined with ingredients that worked, but nothing overly impressive.\n\nThe mains had were the Perthshire red leg partridge and the Aberdeen aged beef fillet.  I enjoyed the partridge and all its little garnishes and trimmings.  The skin separately crisped then rolled back onto the flayed meat pieces, provided for the perfect bite of meat.  The puree went harmoniously with the protein and the croutons did add the nice crunch; however, the overall plate was more a visual dance than a tribute to taste.  Aberdeen fillet was delicious, and a bit carried away.  There was too much going on in that plate, and cannot say all of them worked.  \n\nFor fine dining, doesn't quite hit the spot.  For atmosphere, its nice but a bit rigid.\nSomething here seemed a tad mismatched for me.  Dishes were slightly outdated and not as innovative for fine dining but prices were fairer than at proper fine dining restaurants.  But then again, this felt more like an attempt at imitating what fine dining should be rather than the menu displaying actual culinary zeal.  It was all a bit boring.  If I want fine dining or even something similar, I'd choose another.  Had a reasonably good experience, but for what it is you can have better elsewhere.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Staff was attentive but not hovering. Food was spectacular starting with the amuse bouche - a warm chestnut, potato, leak purée with truffle and peanut oil - it was delicious and just the perfect temperature served in a small elegant glass on a plank of hardwood as a serving tray. Just very thoughtful and the flavors were perfect. For appetizers Debra got the Loch Crab Cannelloni and I ordered the Hom Ham tureen with Scallop. The crab was wrapped in a paper thin crepe on a small bed of greens suspended over sauce infused with beets all in a cone shaped glass that fit into a narrow throated glass bowl. The  bowl contained yet another sauce at the bottom and filing the rest of the bowl was a fog of smoke from hardwood. The two glasses were separated and the smoke released exciting the senses.  Each component was  tasted individually before mixing into what Debra described as the most luscious crab she has ever had. There were so many components that it was hard to make them all out. However, the result was a merging of flavors that was unique and in a class by itself. The tureen was also spectacular , packed with succulent ham in a flavorful gelatin where hints of coriander, clove, mustard and garlic seemed to be present. It was topped with a perfectly cooked medium sized scallop with small cubes of jelly for accompaniment . I honestly cannot identify what those cubes were made from but that didn't stop me from using a bit with each bite. Fabulous!\nMain courses did not disappoint. Debra's pork belly was soooo scrumptious she said not a word to me during that course except to make some sounds of joy after each bite. My duck breast with sausage rolls and tarragon jus was as the Italians say \"OTTIMO\" the ultimate. Perfectly cooked rare with crisp skin and the portion size was more than adequate. I was in heaven and the glass of Rioja I had with it was icing on the cake.\nWe finally shared a deconstructed peanut butter caramel cheese cake with hot chocolate sauce - as we ooh'ed and ahh'ed our way through that imaginative and just incredible dessert we both looked at each other and said, \"it really doesn't get any better than this!\" but we were wrong because when the bill came we could not believe that food this good could be so reasonably priced. It was worth every penny for sure, and it was one of the best dinning experiences Debra and I have had. We cannot say enough about it except to say we will be back!

Although the menu was different to the main one, it still certainly looked good.\nWe arrived just before our table booking time and were shown straight to our table. The restaurant was pretty quiet, we were the only ones in our part of the restaurant, I think this was probably due to it being mid week and school holidays. Anyway I digress! The place is stunning, although I think it would be a bit more comfortable with a few more people in.\n\nWe looked at the menu, but in reality have both pretty much chosen in advance. I ordered the 'Ham Hough and Shallot Terrine' starter, and '11 Hour Slow Roasted Pork Belly' main. \n\nGiven that I haven't a clue about wine we asked the restaurant manageress (not a clue if this is the right title!) to advise us. Given that this is a very fancy place, this worried me! I needn't have been, we got a really nice bottle of white which didn't break the bank (£21 I think). \n\nFirst to come out was a pea and mint puree amuse bouche (I only just learnt the name). A pleasant surprise before our starter. It was nice, not my favourite part of the meal, but certainly did it's job in preparing us for the starter.\n\nThis was followed shortly by some nice warm bread, and then our starters.\nVisually it was great. Yet surprisingly for 'fine dining' it was fairly substantial too. It came with red wine jelly, roasted hazelnuts and hazelnut mayo. \nThe hazelnut and terrine was a great combination of flavours. My only suggestion would be for more of the actual hazelnuts, or for the mayo to be more strongly flavoured.\n\nOnto the main....\nAgain arriving promptly the main looked just as good. As well as the belly pork there was sliced pork fillet, pomme puree (a nice creamy mashed potato for the common of us), savoy cabbage, and cubes of toffied apple. \nThe pork fillet was really tender and tasty, mash was really smooth (but not too much). The real winner (and my favourite bit of the meal by far) was the slow roasted pork belly. I've not seen such a uniform piece of belly pork (a perfect square with immaculate crackling), but this attention certainly didn't take away from it's substance. It was very much 'melt in the mouth' stuff! The only thing it was lacking in my opinion was salt to bring the flavour out. However unlike a lot of people, I prefer it this way so it can be added to taste. The flaked salt  (so much better than other types!) provided did the job perfectly.\n\nSo that was that then. A great deal from Yelp, but I'd certainly go back to try the full menu sometime. The staff were great; professional yet friendly and happy to chat unlike some other high end restaurants. \n\nI've given 4 stars. I did consider 5 but I'm always reluctant to do this even at the best of times. I have no particular reason for not giving 5, but I think there's always room to improve (is there such thing as perfection).\n\nOk, enough of my long-winded nonsense. Give Mark Greenaway's a try, you certainly won't regret it!\n\nGeoff","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

The food is creative, upscale, and luxurious.  I was fortunate enough to be invited to a special meal hosted by the sponsors of this excellent website to celebrate the fall menu.\n\nI had a wonderfully creative starter: smoked scottish salmon, homemade black pudding on tiny tattie scone, and poached quail egg on foie gras (eat your heart out SF!).  The dish was soft and luscious, with dark and smoky notes.  Sadly it was under seasoned, spoiling pure enjoyment.  Overall the perfect execution of each of the elements more than made up for this transgression. \n\nMy main was an 11 hour smoked pork belly, served with the most velvety canelle of mashed potato, a lovely cabbage slaw, and a few slices of juicy pork loin.  The plate was kissed with a toffee sauce that was pure sweet and salty heaven.  The belly itself was absolutely perfect, soft fat sandwiched between smoked meat and crispy cracklin.  I would have loved a bit more sauce (actually I would have downed a glass of it if offered), and maybe more cabbage or another vegetable on the plate might have helped cut the richness of the meat and mash.  Despite these suggestions the dish itself was a meat-lovers triumph, and I can see why it is one of Mark's signature dishes.\n\nDesert was a celebration of chocolate so rich it might have defeated a lesser man.  Luckily I was up to the challenge (ok maybe the wee dram of Caol Ila fortified me a bit).  The presentation was stunning (true of all the dishes really), with a perfectly cooked fondant cake balanced by layered white chocolate mousse wrapped in a delicate chocolate.  Orange caviar rounded out the plate.  The cake was rich, dark, and sinful, perfect 70% cocoa simplicity.  I don't normally like white chocolate, but the mousse was soft and tangy, perfect to cut the richness of the chocolate.  The orange caviar was clever, but could have been integrated better into the dish.\n\nOverall an incredible meal, amazingly progressed and well presented.  The quality of ingredients and care in preparation make it easy to overlook the minor flaws in execution.  I will most assuredly be back to see what else Mark has to offer.

I did not know that much about the place before so had no real expectations before.\n\nNot sure how the dining scene in Edinburgh normally works but was surprised that the place was fairly empty on a Thursday night but not that it bothered us. It did look a bit fancy and upscale so we did feel that we should perhaps have dressed up but when looking around it seemed as it was not really expected (at least judging from the guest at the few other tables).\n\nThe service was friendly and efficient,the only thing that was slightly confusing was that we had 4 people involved in our service during the evening. There was a clear difference in skill and knowledge and the sommelier appeared to be the most knowledgeable on both wines and the food so ended up asking him any questions.\n\nThe food was excellent for everyone. A lot of effort also went into the presentation of the food and while it at times felt as if they were trying a bit too hard everything did taste wonderful. I had the pork belly as a main that was excellent (pate as a starter, also great) and the others at the table were also happy with their choices. Desserts delivered as well. \n\nValue for money was excellent and it was without a doubt the best meal we had in Edinburgh.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Knowing it was a celebration for us, Mark had left an anniversary card from himself on the table (a keepsake!) and we were soon nursing a couple of glasses of bubbly - lovely stuff, thanks Mark! \n\nThe restaurant itself was fitted out in a contemporary versus traditional sort of fashion and was relaxing and interesting.  I was particularly drawn to the main lighting of the room.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Don Nicanor's 2012 Malbec (Mendoza) to help us peruse the menu.  This was decided on with a little help from our fantastic sommelier (I think there were two sommeliers on that night!) and it sure was a lovely Malbec.\n\nNot long after ordering we were presented with some lovely fresh bread & butter and an amuse-bouche of tomato gazpacho (tomatoes sourced from Cyrenians Farm, a Social Enterprise just outside Edinburgh that Mark sources a lot of fresh ingredients from) with basil and roasted cucumber and tomato jelly.  This was really tasty, classic combination of tomato and basil and the jelly was a new one on us and went really well. It was served on a piece of wood from Mark's partner's parents' garden! \n\nMrs G chose the venison carpaccio served with soused tomatoes, tomato tartare and parmesan \"snow\" to start.  She enjoyed this very much and wolfed up every last bit.  The tartare added a subtle sharpness which complimented the rest of the dish very well, the capers, cornichons (I think!) and parmesan topped it off with style. \n\nI'd opted for the duo of hand dived west coast scallops which came served with pork crackling, Dashi broth, soy caramel, sea vegetables and rice wine vinegar jelly.  One scallop owas cooked with the soy caramel whereas the other one was served in the shell with the crackling and was finely sliced and raw.  The eating process involved cooking the raw one by pouring the broth over it and letting it cook while devouring the other.  This added a bit of fun to the dish and I liked the thinking behind it.  This dish was simply delicious!\n\nWe were then presented with a Cona coffee-maker full of Mark's take on cock-a-leekie soup.  Again this added some fun to this (unexpected) dish.  I'd seen Jak O'Donnell using one of these on Great British Menu just a couple of weeks before this visit so was most pleased to see it in action up close!  The percolated broth was poured over the chicken, rice and fig.  This was delicious, so fresh and clean tasting as well as having that x-factor buzz.\n \nMoving onto the mains and Mrs G had chosen to go with the beef, or more accurately, the 40-day dry aged fillet of Aberdeen Angus.  This was accompanied by a celeriac gratin, oxtail cannelloni, wild mushrooms, watercress purée and a red wine jus.  Safe to say she absolutely loved this dish too, insisting I tried it.  I duly obliged.  The beef was pink and tender, as it should be served (the waitress had mentioned this was how it came which pleased us both).  The accompaniments were equally good, it was a strong main course; it was also presented in an elegant, contemporary fashion.\n\nI really could not make my mind up right up to the point of ordering.  Somehow, the words \"I'll go with the pork\" came out.  Upon seeing my 11 hour slow roasted Clash Farm belly of pork served with a pork cheek \"pie\", blackened fillet, sweetcorn and toffee apple jus, I was very happy!  It looked terrific and tasted utterly amazing.  Every single morsel of food on this well thought out plate was delectable!  It really was special.\n\nWe were then brought, as a wee refresher, what Mark describes as strawberries and custard, and what I would describe as a strawberry panna cotta-like pot of beauty!  This really was delicious and probably should have quelled my desire for a dessert!\n\nMrs G decided to forego dessert in favour of cheese and selected the Cornish Yang, Lanark Blue and Brie Campagnard.  These were served with frozen grapes, quince, oatcakes, crackers, celery and apricot.  We both very much enjoyed these lovely cheeses.\n\nI decided to forego cheese in favour of dessert and opted for \"Mark's Great British Menu \"Knot\" Chocolate Tart\".  This came with custard jelly, frozen cookies, crème fraiche parfait, salted caramel and kumquat purée.  The presentation was amazing and it was matched by the flavours.  Everything worked together so well and I had no trouble finishing it all off.  Delicious.\n\nWe were now both full to the brim and ordered a couple of espressos to try and offset the sleepiness.  These came with homemade chocolate bars, white chocolate lollipops and fruit pastilles.  The indulgence continued!  Again, everything was truly excellent!\n\nThis was a hugely successful trip to Mark Greenaway and I can easily understand why there were no empty tables; he has got a fantastic name for himself here and quite rightly so.  Superb service, environment, presentation, quality and taste.  Restaurant Mark Greenaway oozes brilliance.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Our waiting staff were friendly, attentive and had the right balance of being highly professional, but completely approachable. The restaurant itself is beautifully designed with a clever mix of classic and contemporary, and provided a perfect venue for a memorable meal.\n\nHowever, as Ms Woolf quite rightly points out, the dining is the most important part of the happiness experience, and blimey were we happy.  Every single dish was admired, gushed over and appreciated fully before we even lifted our forks and knives.\n\nFor me, it was a starter of Hand-Dived Orkney Sea Scallops which were prepared perfectly and served on a pomme fondant. Tender, sweet and wonderfully balanced with tomato jelly and parsley mayonnaise. I have never savoured a dish so much...until my main course! Pan Roasted Hake fillet was next with purple mash, lobster tortellini and pumpkin. It was delicate, and so fresh I suspect it leaped straight out of the sea onto my plate. The combination of flavours was sublime, the dish was beautifully presented and my plate was spotless at the end.\n\nDuring my meal I had a couple of glasses of a tasty Sauvignon Blanc, which went well with my seafood starter and main course and, at £5 a glass, was excellent value.\n\nTo end, I choose a Chocolate Fondant with a vanilla tuile, white chocolate mousse and tonka bean ice cream. This was again presented with such elegance, and was absolutely delicious. Every element combined well and the dish had the right balance of hot & cold, sweet (but not overly!) with the rich cocoa working well with orange caviar.\n\nEverything was relaxed, each dish was served at just the right time and the conversations flowed. As a wonderful conclusion, we had a visit from Mark and a personal tour around the new hotel rooms upstairs from the restaurant. They were absolutely gorgeous, and excellent value for money, as was our meal.\n\nAs I was finishing this review, I pondered the thoughts of one Mr Mark Twain, who wrote, \"When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat\"...\n\n...after this meal, I think we would all agree it was just like Heaven!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

That would make me the happiest little lady in Edinburgh, ever. Fact.\n\nI have now returned to Mark Greenaway twice. Once with some yelpers, and after having mentioned this visit to my friend the prompt response was table, in two weeks time, us, book, now. I was hardly going to say no!?\n\nThe first visit with the yelpers was amazing. Crab cannelloni with smoked cauliflower custard. I was in awe when it came out, presentation is spot on, as was the taste of course!! Lifting off that little cone on top to be greeting by the most scrummy smokey smell, brilliant. Then there was the main.\n\n This main is without a doubt the best plate of food I have ever eaten.\n\nGressingham Duck with potato croquettes, sausage roll, watermelon and tarragon gravy. It was mind blowing, the flavour of that gravy was so intense and delicious we may have had to ask for some more bread to mop it up with. The duck, unlike most duck I have had, was melt in the mouth. Not in the slightest bit chewy as it sometimes can be. Sausage roll, potato croquette..... man. I may sound like I am totally exaggerating, but as the other yelpers will verify, it is THAT good.\n\nOn the second visit, I had parsnip veloute to start, which I had quite eagerly just jumped past whilst scanning the options. But on further inspection it came with a ham hough tortellini, curried parsnips and parsnip crisps. Yes please. My friend opted for the same, and we were both totally pleased with our choice, simply devine. Then for main I had hake with lobster ravioli, purple mash and a ginger and spring onion broth. I don't even like ginger!?! I swear I could come here and be given a whole plate based entirely on mushrooms and I would be converted. Again, utterly flawless, the fish was cooked to perfection. All the flavours are well balanced and compliment each other perfectly.\n\nOk, now I am starting to rant on a little. So I shall break it down into simple points as to why, after reading this long winded review, you should go eat here\n\n- My friend that came on the second visit, drove all the way down from Aberdeen for the weekend just so he could come. \n- I have been three times, and each time I have had the chocolate fondant. If I were to go back tonight, I would have it again!\n- The service is always attentive and friendly.\n\n.........Oh yeah, and did I mention the life changing Duck!?!?","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Ouch.\n\nAfter my previous amazing meal at MG, I had been going on about wanting to return for over a year.  So, The Man surprised me by booking lunch here on NYE.  \n\nMy first visit was when the restaurant was located on Picardy Place.  Unfortunately I found that the move to N Castle Terrace resulted in a downgrade in surroundings as well as food.  \n\nWhen eating at a restaurant that is aiming for a Michelin star, you don't expect the wait staff to wear dirty uniforms that are missing buttons, and you don't expect the stairwell to the toilets to be scuffed and dirty.  Once you get to the bottom of the scruffy stairs, you are in a cold, dank corridor that leads you to toilets that were \"upgraded\" by painting the tiles black.  Tiles + paint + time = scratches and general shabbiness.  So far, nothing particularly rang of \"fine dining.\"\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if the standard of food was what I remembered.  My starter (a veloute) was tasty though a bit uninteresting, and in The Man's pan fried duck egg, the duck egg itself was undercooked to the point of still having clear eggy slime on the top.\n\nI opted for the slow cooked pork belly that stole my heart on my previous visit, and The Man had what I believe must have been the oven roasted salmon.  He *loved* the soft shelled crab but found the rest of the dish to be standard fare.  My pork belly was nice but dry and lacking in some kind of oomph.\n\nThe theme here is that the food was perfectly nice, but wasn't exciting.  Everything was absolutely fine but not what I expected from Mark Greenaway.   I'm probably being too extreme in my opinions considering we had three courses for £20 which is a fabulous deal, but if I had paid full price for the food I would have been UNimpressed.  \n\nThe bright star of the meal was the maitre d'\/sommelier.  He was wonderful, charming, friendly and spot on with service.  \n\nBut, unfortunately I left feeling let down.

Not only had Mark featured on Great British Menu last month but it was my first visit to the new site on North Castle Street apart from a quick chat with the infamous chef previously and a fab meal at the last place.\n\nIt seemed such a long time and long wait with baited breath since Mark announced his plans to move from Picardy Place to an unknown location, in what seemed a very exciting move for a chef who seems to be going from strength to strength in the Edinburgh food scene.\n\nAs always on enetering Loic the sommelier extroidinaire greeted us warmly amd seated us at the table which was elegantly laid out by the lovely Georgian windows. The Restaurant is located in what used to be a bank and retains many of the original features including a vault! More on that later. The restaurant is decorated in subtle colours with an amazing chandelier that gives a romantic glow when the sun goes down.\n\nWe all decided to go with the A La Carte Menu as it was a celebration. Dishes tasted included expertly seasoned Scallops, wood pidgeon and a ham hock terrine - all devoured. One of our friends who had the pidgeon literally ran out of words talking about their starter  \n\nI ordered monkfish in a red wine reduction with octopus and mark went for the 11 hour slow roasted pork belly with pomme puree, savoy cabbage and toffee apple jus.  Which I kind of wanted myself!\n\nThe monkfish was really lovely and not something I would have normally chosen but it came recommended by Loic. I have to also say the wines he chose for us were FANTASTIC and really reasonable in comparison to other restaurants where you struggle to get a good, reasonable wine under £40!\n\nMark's pork belly is a dish I just adore.  The well -sourced meat was juicy and full of taste, the crackling perfectly crunchy without being too hard and the mash was smooth as silk.  The toffee apple jus was not too sweet and a great modern twist on the classic pork and apple pairing. One of our friends had the duck course from GBM and loved it! \n\nNow for the dessert course, with the Chocolate Knot tart - my third time - a broken chocolate tart with crème fraiche parfait, frozen cookies, salted caramel and kumquat puree, not to mention popping candy which again you may have seen on Great British Menu? \n\nAs I mentioned before they have the wine cellar in the bank vaults and Loic gave us the grand tour which is a rather novel touch to the dining experience.

Winter-time winner. \n\nHake with herb crust, parsnip cake, butter oysters and saffron 'air.' Oysters were divine and the hake perfectly done. Herb crust was a bit intense to eat on its own, but flavoured the fish well.\n\nMark has done a good job of balancing fine dining with local, seasonal food, and a proper yet unsnobby atmosphere (though the other patrons seemed to be a lot of banker-types). \n\nThis experience at £20 or less per head?

My first experience of Mark Greenaway was as a result of yelp for the Raconteur pop up bar which was absolutely amazing!! I love cocktails but probably stick to my old favourites so it was nice to experience a menu which differed from the rest all of which had my tastebuds buzzing with excitement - the Summer cup martini was just to DIE for!! You can really taste the fruit and the kick is so smooth it can be dangerous.. They are just too moreish!!\n\nGutted when Taste of Edinburgh was cancelled I decided I had to try the food at 12 Picardy Place.. So after a revisit for a cheeky wee Raconteur cocktail we headed downstairs to try the Market menu - 3 courses of fantastic food for £20! Well at that price it would be rude not to!! \n\nAs a renowned 'fussy' eater (and gluten free) I was so happy to see a menu where there were several things I wanted to try... After much deliberation I opted for the Ham hock terrine to start which when it arrived I felt almost guilty about eating as it was soo beautifully presented.. with interesting mallow like swirls, jelly cubes, a scallop and scattered flowers each mouthful was a new adventure! This was followed by the 12 hour slow-roasted pork belly with a toffee-apple jus..... WOW!! The crackling was just amazing and the pork so tender and juicy and accompanied by the most amazing tasting and textured creamy mash potato - I'm sure it probably had a better description on the menu but I can say that my tastebuds were on overdrive! I really thought things couldnt get much better.... then dessert arrived - salted caramel cheesecake straight from Heaven!! Every mouthful was savoured in that eyes closed kind of way!! \n\nThe attention to detail in the presentation of all of the food was exquisite and the tastes were like a fireworks display on your tongue!

I was very excited to come along.\n\nFirstly, we were greeted by some delicious Perrier-Jouët champagne, which definitely went down a treat. The amuse-bouche selection was beautifully presented and delicious. I really enjoyed the crab (and I think with avocado) and the duck eggs benedict. So this certainly prepared us for the starter to come.\n\nWe had a lovely room, which is obviously used for private dining or larger parties, through the back of the restaurant, which was really nice and intimate. \n\nMark was giving people the chance to try each of the courses he presented. We had the starter which consisted of braised pork cheek, hot apple jelly and sea buckthorn. Certainly, I was interested to try this, having never tried cold pork cheek or sea buckthorn. \n\nTo be honest the sea buckthorn did have a very aniseedy flavour, but the other flavours in the dish took most of that away, and it just gave it that spark of something different to taste. I thought the cubes of apple jelly were delicious and complimented the pork cheek very well, which was perfectly cooked and tender. There were some lovely bright pink 'petals' which looked gorgeous and the colours rerally were spectacular.\n\nWe watched the show live, which was great fun and met Mark who was really down to earth and friendly. It was funny hearing his stories of how different the chefs are from what, we as viewers, see once the finished programme has been edited.\n\nAnyway, all in all a great night and I'm looking forward to episode 2 tonight.

(Okay, I'm still about 20 odd behind from Decembers lot!)\n\nChose here, as reviews were pretty good & had old work colleagues up visiting Edinburgh from London, so thought a nice wee change from 'chains' was in order.\n\nLovely location, but I couldn't help feeling that the interior layout of the tables, was rather 'busy' and felt close together when you first walk in.  That said, once I was sat at the table, you actually were quite a way from the next table.  It just needs a bit more thought on interior design for first impressions.  A new carpet (or one vacuumed!) on the staircase to the bathrooms wouldn't go a miss! :-)\n\nAnyhoo.. onto food and drink.  I tried a sample of Pinot Noir & then couldn't have it as no bottles in stock...  offered another option, but was advised it was 50p a glass more.  Now, I have no issue with that, but surely if you run out of stock and thats my only other option, you really wouldn't bother charging a first time customer, a poultry 50 pence more!\n\nWe all opted for the Market Menu (2 courses) at £16.50 each. (£20 for 3).  Great value, but I didn't feel the choices were mind blowing particularly.  Choice of three dishes and vegetarian option was a porridge..hmm.  I don't like salmon, so my only choice was belly pork.  I'm on a new health kick, so belly pork wasn't ideal!  I did ask if we could substitute main course from a la carte menu & pay the surplus - No was the firm answer.  Frankly, that doesn't make sense, as it would have only resulted in us paying the restaurant £30\/40 more...\n\nService from waiters was excellent.  Right balance of attention & leaving you alone, with good humour thrown in.  What I didn't like was the whole shirt and tie suited & booted look from them all.  I was pretty smart casual, but even I felt uncomfortably under dressed!\n\nThis isn't a michelin star restaurant & even at that, having dined at michelin starred restaurants, they don't even try that hard to impress!!  CHILL!!  Overly formal & frankly, unnecessary.\n\nPork Belly crackling was simply the best I've had.  However, the pork underneath, as well cooked and tender as it was, really didn't have any individual taste of its own.  Quite bland had it not been for the toffee sauce, mash & the crackling.\n\nPeanut butter brittle cheesecake was a work of art & extremely tasty - the saving course of the meal.  \n\nBill came to £82 (minus tip) for 3 people, 3 wines, 2 soft drinks and 3 teas on top of the 2 courses.  You can't really argue with that - fantastic value.  Had I dined from the A La Carte, I would have expected much more wow for my buck.  When the average main course is £27\/30, you're looking at a 3 course bill of around £60\/65 for one person with a glass of wine & a coffee.  \n\nWould I eat here again?  Yes, it's a nice change from the normal, but I wouldn't 'rush' back and make the trip out specifically.\n\nYou Gotta Eat Here - For Sure! :-D","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I hadn't heard any reviews or recommendations of the restaurant; no one I knew had been. I knew vaguely of the restaurant and nurtured some desire to try it out mainly through my repeated visits of Hawke & Hunter above (and below) the restaurant. A firm favourite drinkery of mine, so I assumed their class and quality would reflect in the attached restaurant.\n\nIn short: My expectations were met.\n\nFor starters I opted for the Ham Hou-- \n\nBut wait! What's this? This cheeky green concoction?\n\nBefore our starters were delivered, the waitress surprised our table with a complimentary aperitif of amuse bouche of warm pea mousse with truffle oil.\n\nFantastic! But wait (again)! Did you say peas?? I hate peas!\n\nUnless, it appears, they are done like this...! I'll admit, I supped on the pea mousse out of politeness and I did not expect to like it as much as I did. But over all I was most impressed with the quality of this complimentary dish.\n\nMust've been the truffle oil...... ;)\n\nSo for starters I opted for the Ham Hough Terrine with Red Wine Jelly, Roasted Hazelnut, Hazelnut Mayo and Toast. In a word: terrific. And an impressively attractive dish.\n\nNext up, and the reason I couldn't wait to come to Greenaway's, I had the 11 Hour Slow Roasted Clash Farm Belly Pork with Pomme Puree, Savoy Cabbage and Toffee Apple Jus. Oh, the toffee apple jus! Anyone who knows me, knows I love my pork. Especially the belly. But this.... best belly ever! Crisp skin followed by immaculate layers of soft, moist pork, couple with the jus and the puree.\n\nUp there in my top meals of all time based on the main course alone!\n\nMy only regret is coming for lunch, as it meant my time had to be brief. If I had come in the evening I would have paid the extra dragons for a dessert of Bramley Apple Plated Six Ways (Pie, Jelly, Crisps, Sorbet, Mousse, Soup). Alas time was against us. but there's always next time.\n\nAnd Mark, be sure, there will be a next time. Looking forward to coming back and seeing the rest of that enticing menu.\n\nJen has since told me of Mark's enthusiasm and encouragement for Yelp. I must say, to have a restaurant of this quality on your side is a massive ally in Yelp's slow but steady world takeover bid. I only look forward to more collaborations between the two. A big thank you to Mark Greenaway for his positive stance on Yelp and moreover his incredible talent for food.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

I felt that the stairs leading down to the private room (and the toilets for it) were a bit dingy and not very welcoming, but this wasn't really a big deal for me personally.\n\nThe staff were absolutely brilliant the entire night - we didn't end up leaving the place til well after midnight and they remained cheery and extremely attentive! We were seated at the big square table and given Prosecco while we perused the menu. In true Debs style, I'd already picked out what I was having pretty much as soon as I knew where we were going so I was really looking forward to my food! We were also given bread while we waited which was good as most of us were starving by that point.\n\nI had the crab starter (see photo) and it was proper dining theatre - the cannelloni dish sat on top of the smoked cauliflower custard dish to begin with, and when it was removed, smoke which had been kept underneath to flavour the custard billowed out, it was so cool!! The cannelloni was brilliant, really refreshing and light and I could've easily eaten about three of them. Unfortunately I wasn't keen on the custard, it was a bit too smoky and strong for my taste buds to handle but I ate the crab out of it because crab. We were also told which way the chef recommended we eat the dish - that's how you know you're in a fancy place!\n\nI had braised beef daube for main and this was pretty substantial! I ended up palming some of it off to the bf and a couple of my colleagues cause they'd already wolfed their turkey (I'm assured it was very tasty!) and by that point it was getting too late for me to handle a heavy meal. The beef itself was well cooked, and the veggies which came with it were also really nice. Although I did feel the beef was slightly lacking in flavour - I had similarly done beef at the Yelp Christmas dinner and I probably actually preferred that! Although I maybe should've just changed my meal up a bit and that might've helped ha.\n\nNow the dessert. Oh my. This was definitely a triumph! The treacle tart was very tasty and rich, I love my cakes\/desserts and this was probably the course I'd been looking forward to the most, so I was very happy indeed! The honeycomb and tuile biscuit were totally divine as well and the little vanilla lollipop (almost ice cream like in consistency but very smooth!) was a fab touch.\n\nAs I said before, absolutely cannot fault the service - the staff were constantly filling up our wine\/water and making sure everything was ok, and nothing was too much trouble for them. The music they had playing in the room was a tad strange, felt a bit more like we were in a swanky nightclub than a swanky restaurant, but I'm not taking anything away from them for that!!\n\nGreat for a properly classy dining experience!!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Their selection of cold beverages was limited, and not particularly cheap, but there went plenty of staff on for a Tuesday morning and service was quick and friendly.\n\nThe tables and decor have a stylishly rough edge to them, which was fine. I wondered if they had made a decision when doing up the place that they didn't need to finish the plastering and paint stripping if they just made a feature of it. It doesn't seem to have put people off though, there was plenty of action and activity.

They show a consistent wish to become better at what they do, and it shows.\n\nTheir flat whites are consistently top notch, as are their cortados and long blacks. Sometimes, I'll go for a cheeky mocha in a flat white cup, and it's superbly chocolatey without being too sweet.\n\nThe place is usually packed with people, which is a shame as you can't be guaranteed a seat if you're more than one or two people, but they use their space well and you can't really fault them for being popular.\n\nThe food is great, with very crusty baguettes (on the tough side for some to chew, but I love bread that gives a bit of fight) wonderful soups (different, fluffier bread comes with this) and really rather lovely salads as well. As an omnivore with vegetarian leanings, I love that their vegetarian and vegan options are just as inviting as their meat options and usually completely different, rather than just being the meat option without meat or something like that. Cakes and pastries are always fresh and full of flavour as well.\n\nFinally, and very importantly, the staff clearly care about the products they make and sell, and they do so with an inviting air about them, unlike some other coffee shops in Edinburgh who might have been around for longer but who've put themselves out of my favour by being at times incredibly dismissive of customers who don't conform to their standards.

My conclusion is: I love it here! \n\nI'll tell you why. \n\n1. It has many plugs for laptops, and strong wifi. I can spend lots of time working here on my computer and not feel pressured to leave! This brings in a good atmosphere, I can come in here to chill out. \n\n2. As Napoleon Dynamite says: \"Chicks only dig guys with skillz\". Well.. these guys have skillz, coffee making skillz. You can tell they are passionate about what they do, everyone is really approachable and happy. The staff can bring a good or bad atmosphere to a place, and I think in the case of Brew lab, theres definitely happy times all around. \n\n3. The food is delicious. These guys just bring in the people who can do it right. Example: Union of Genius for soups and salads. I get so excited when I hear bout the specials of the day. Everything has been excellent so far, and the bread always fresh! \n\n4. The decor is different! Or, well lack-of. The look of the place is really interesting, and the bathrooms are CLEAN. That's always a big one in Edinburgh. It's hard to find a decent bathroom!!! \n\n5. The loyalty card. I don't have one yet, but I heard it's awesome. There's different tiers for the loyalty card, so instead of just getting a free coffee when you've purchased 10, you can get another card that gives better rewards. For example, free coffee for you and a friend!  \n\nAnyways, I'm pretty much becoming a regular here. I really enjoy it, and if you're a coffee lover I recommend stopping by.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

However, as the Brunch staff have recently selfishly decided that Sundays should be a day of rest, I'm without a café to supply me with sausage rolls on the Sabbath.  So far I've just restricted my breakfast roll habit to a Saturday, but as I recently had guests staying over who were in need of meat and bread I made the trip to Word of Mouth.\n\nAlas! I have been spoilt by the Brunch's super cheap prices, and was aghast to see that Word of Mouth charged about £3.50 for a roll with 3 fillings, and about £2 (I can't remember exactly, might have been anywhere between £1.80 and £2.20) for one filling. That is an expensive roll when I'm used to a base price of £1.40 plus 40p per extra item.\n\nFortunately the quality of said rolls just about justifies the expense. These are ciabatta rolls (the owner said he much prefers them to normal bread ones), and the quality of the sausages, bacon, eggs etc is wonderful. Delicious. A bit mean to cut the link sausages in half so you actually only get 2 sausages in your roll, but tasty at least.\n\nNow it only takes me a little over 10 minutes to walk there, but I feel that's too long to be walking back while my food is getting cold, so my trips there in future will be restricted to either sitting in or the rare occasions (such as last weekend) when I have the use of a car. And the vast difference in cost between it and the Brunch means I'll really only make the journey when I NEED a breakfast roll. But, the café itself looks lovely so it may well be that I'll be back soon - but for a sit-in lunch this time.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

No doubt a lot of Leithers will already frequent Word of Mouth, but the simple, wooden furniture, modern, coloured lamps hanging overhead and relaxed vintage feel of this cafe will definitely tempt me to walk a bit further away from town in the future. The staff were lovely, and the feeling of the clientele and the place was chilled out and easy. Much to my annoyance, I wasn't at all hungry, but the mezze section of the ethically sourced food menu looked fantastic, as did the homemade cakes on display.

Its walls pay tribute to bygone era's, with a lot of 50s pin up art gracing the walls. It's not the kind of place where an employee is going to get sacked for wearing a headband and hanging a picture up in the wrong place, which is what wins me over most of all.

You've been the setting for many important times in my life - a successful first date, an outpouring of grief after sitting my final university exams round the corner, sitting down and planning a post-uni holiday. I used to think your periodic table menu of coffee was the epitome of cool. I think I've sat at each of your tables at least once. You'll always have a special place in my heart. But I'm afraid you're just not cutting it for me anymore. \n\nLet's get one thing down for certain - this place does very good coffee. Maybe even the best coffee in Edinburgh (up there with Artisan Roast). And I don't mind paying for quality coffee. But I do mind paying £4.70 for a tuna baguette that is just a bit meh. No garnish. No crisps. Just a (actually painfully chewy) baguette with some filling. \n\nThe tea is cute, what with the wee timer and tray and all that jazz, but again - it's pricey. \n\nMaybe I'm just too conventional these days, but I just think Brew Lab now loves itself a bit too much. It's cool, but it knows it. It's popular, and it knows it. But maybe it needs to keep an eye on its quality and value for money. Or maybe I just no longer have tolerance for places with bare filament lights and no paint on the walls.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

An all-encompassing description from which I took the following meaning - that the coffee here was going to be awesome (and potent) and that this place was something new and different, a bit of a Dean Moriarty character striding onto the coffee scene with a buzz in its step and a love of espresso and all these exciting ideas that would instantly make people listen and want to congregate in the same place and drink it all in......ok, maybe I've got a bit carried away, but I'm obssessed with On the Road and I'm going to America soon, so I'm a bit over-excited.\n\nThe point is, this is something new for Edinburgh. It might not be exactly what everyone wants to the perfect degree but it's got a freshness about it, and a real feeling of wanting to do something different by creating an alternative cafe scene within the city...the people working there genuinely want you to get to know coffee and what's amazing about it and to figure out your own personal coffee palate, and I like that.\n\nAdditional attributes - plentiful working areas, a good vibe of general work and study, more than several plug sockets and free wi-fi.\n\nThey have a coffee machine called the Slayer - it's a manual machine on which you can adjust the pressure and if you know what you're doing your espresso pours brilliantly with beautiful heart and crema (trying to pull out all my old barista lingo from the archives) and your day proceeds wonderfully. \n\nThe food is really, really good - I've gone for whatever salad they've had on each time I've been in just about, and I've never been disappointed. The portions are generous, and the ingredient concoctions they assemble are a bit different.\n\nThe plan is that they're going to start holding different arts events (and I think gigs) at Brew Lab, and I think increasing hanging out opportunities at the venue by extending the opening hours would really be a banterful move. I'm looking forward to that when it happens.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Now THIS is the place to come if you're into coffee, and like trying out coffees that have been made with a range of brewing methods.\n\nBrew Lab are very proud of their filter coffee, so that's what we tried when we arrived about lunch-time ish. The coffee-theatre to this is fantastic, and it's fascinating watching the process and precision with which is is made.  The first step is that the Barista empties a single-serve container of coffee beans into the grinder. You really can't get any fresher than that! \n\nThey keep it simple here. The coffee menu has four rotating single-origin coffees: two brewed on the brew bar as pour-overs, and two on the espresso bar.  If I lived nearby, I would try them all in rotation, to experience the differences, and improve my understanding of coffee. On the day we visited, we chose the Guatemalan filter coffee, and it was incredibly tasty. Brew Lab sure do know their coffee.\n\nThey have a small food menu, and I was pleased to see items that were vegan friendly. I had a sourdough baguette filled with peanut butter, siracha, carrot, cucumber and watercress. This was a combination that I would never have thought of in a million years. Surprisingly, it worked really well, it was delicious. \n\nThere was an impressive range of cakes, but we passed, having had an elegant sufficiency with our tasty baguettes. They also have cold brew. I definitely want to try one of these next time.\n\nThe only slight niggle I had is that half of the place looks half-finished. I know exposed plaster, and lightbulbs hinging from wires is all the rage, but I do feel that they've taken this theme a bit too far, to the extent that it's not very pleasant to sit in. I was actually wondering whether the place was genuinely half-finished. I think they could do a bit better here. It'll be nicer when it's finished.\n\nThat being said, if you can sit in the nice part, that's good, and we loved Brew Lab so much that, having had a good wander about Edinburgh, we actually came back later in the evening. Now, here is where my memory fades slightly. I know I didn't have a coffee, because you know, I like being able to sleep, so I think I had a beer from their pop-up beer menu. We also had some street food from the Fresh Revolution food pop-up. I had the veggie haggis arancini. Again, not a food item I would ever have chosen had I had more of a choice, but it was delicious.\n\nI feel like Brew Lab could offer me a very enjoyable coffee and food education.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The vegan option was a Hummus, sun blush tomatoes, olives and red onion sourdough sandwich, which met with approval. I noticed that the house coffee was called slayer, being the rampant metal head I had to have a cup of this.

I have to admit, I'd be reluctant to come back here for lunch, if I knew I'd have to faff about waiting on the students heading to class so I could sit and get a table to eat. \n\nAfter loitering with intent, we managed to procure a table and got comfy.\n\nLunch was an extremely tasty sourdough sandwich (from an excellent selection!), and a HUGE slice of parsnip & ginger cake, which was moist and delicious. The menu was varied, interesting and left me slightly undecided, I always like when that happens! \n\nService was prompt and attentive, and our very kind waitress even went to find out what song was playing (as we liked it, and wanted to know who it was!). Incidentally, the playlist on the go was fabulous, and the mellow, downtempo tunes were perfect. It was an absolute pleasure to listen to.\n\nHowever, this place is all about the coffee, and what wonderful coffee it was! I'm a creature of habit, and a plain, black coffee is my usual choice. I'm struggling to recall the blend I had, but it was smooth, nutty, inherently sweet & a perfect strength. I would even be tempted to break the 'no milk' habit, and go for a flat white or cappuccino here, so sure would I be that it'd be delicious. In addition, the coffees brewed are regularly changed to ensure our taste-buds are kept on their toes.\n\nNow, I know I was having a moan earlier about the students taking up tables studying but, after lunch, I did sit for a while and read a book. The staff were very good and didn't chase or harass us to go, but by that time there were many more tables free, so I didn't feel so bad. I would have had it been over a busy lunchtime!\n\nSo, just like Marmite, I think this was a day where my mood varied! I didn't love Brew Lab...but then I didn't hate it either.

It deserves it.\n\nI haven't tried every coffee shop in Edinburgh but I'd still be confident in saying none are better than Brew Lab.\n\nThe interior is well polished; stylish and modern but still very warm and comfortable.\n\nThe staff are polite, charming and relaxed. They are obviously very talented baristas, whose knowledge and passion for coffee is obvious.\n\nCoffee is the main draw of Brew Lab. The reason being that they source and frequently rotate the best beans from the best roasters in Europe. A considerable amount of effort (and cost) has obviously been invested in using the top of the range equipment to brew in a variety of ways, getting the best out of the beans. Best of all, I've been able to enjoy a huge selection of wonderful, different flavours and blends that would simply have not been available elsewhere in town.\n\nThe food is also of an equal quality. Serving fresh Union of Genius soups daily, freshly baked baguettes with ever-changing, creative and fresh fillings. Always offering a vegetarian or vegan option as well. I realised I used the word 'fresh' far too much in that sentence but it is a word that seems to perfectly describe Brew Lab, figuratively and literally.\n\nIt's a credit to Edinburgh.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Brew Lab not only offers two espresso blends (one house, one guest), they also have two coffee preparation options (chemex and pour over using a Hario V60). On top of that, there are a couple different beans to choose from when doing a regular coffee. Further, in terms of execution, everything is done very well--all my coffees and espressos have been spot on. Brew Lab also has excellent sweets: the peanut butter shortbread and cream cheese brownies are worth the extra money. \n\nIn terms of the atmosphere, Brew Lab leans towards the modern end of things, and yet there's kind of a classic feel to it, probably because of the red leather easy chairs and throwback benches\/picnic-style tables. Generally, it's very comfortable. It can get crowded, but I have yet to find the space to get loud. \n\nFinally, the staff is courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful.

There's a reason for it, I promise.\n\nFirst off, let me tell you that the sandwiches are absolutely delicious, I've tried them several times now, and yes, they're a little on the expensive side, BUT they are also of the GET IN MAH BELLAY now variety. Which is always a good thing. I like the plays of flavours and approve of the semi-healthiness of the selection (plenty of ruccola on them, my favourite, jummy).\n\nI like the decor, even with the hipsters (there's not too much of it to scare off the lit-students, or wait, are we the hipsters?). \n\nThe coffee, .. I may have caught them on a bad day, all three times I've gone. That is perfectly possible, but I have to be honest. Both me and my girly coffee-date agreed that the coffee was burnt and tasted terribly bitter. Either the machine hadn't been cleaned properly, or the coffee was very over-extracted. Either way, ... look guys, I hate to say it, but they'll have to take a course with Artisan Roast and see how to make a proper coffee. By no means am I saying it's terrible, it's just not a well-made latte, espresso or flat white. The filter coffee could be different, I have no idea as I won't touch the stuff and could be very good as everyone seems to think!\n\n\n[Edit]\nI have since been back to Brew Lab, who can resist their sandwiches, not me, and had a better coffee. The latte I had was not over-extracted, nor did it taste burnt. Was it the best coffee I've ever had? Nope. Did it do the trick and was it better than *shiver* Starbucks? Oh, easily. I think things are moving on up people! One extra star for you!\n\nBrew Lab's on the way to good things, just, send your baristas to Artisan for a coffee-training, please?","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

I like to consider myself a bit of a coffee snob coming from Seattle and all so I was a bit skeptical when everyone told me this was the greatest coffee in the world.

WOW the flavours hit you like a left hook from Rocky Balboa . I didnt even think that this was coffee I was drinking. It was so smooth like silk, with berry hints and no bitterness. Like none, I kept expecting it at the end but it never manifested. Its really hard to get a espresso shot that is not a little bit burnt but these guys did an excellent job of not burning it at all! The place was busy full of college kids and there was no where to sit. They turn the internet off during the busy time of the day to stem people from sitting there all day mooching the free internet but that didnt seem to dieter  them for no one left while I was there. But thats ok for the coffee I will stand on my head if they want! So I believe I have found my new haunt , for this place is just like a coffee shop in Ballard or Queen Ann in Seattle and I can see myself spending some time there studying.

But though I hail from the city that near invented the plaid shirt and pour over trend - i'm actually not much of a coffee connoisseur myself and in fact, have been slowly converting to caffeine free over the last year or so. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a flat white from time to time, but I definitely don't go out of my way to seek out a good cup. \n\nWhich is how I know that this place is still pretty dang great.\n\nWhy? Because a place that makes great coffee is great... for those people who appreciate a great cup of coffee. For folks like myself, that don't really fuss over the particulars, a cafe can't just stand on the quality of their brew. They have to have good customer service or atmosphere to make it into the plus column - preferably both. Brew Lab secures this and adds free wifi to the mix, so yes: i'm a fan.\n\nThe staff here have always been pleasant. The interior is beautiful, with lots of wood, spaces to chat and corners to hide away and get some work done. They have a decent wifi signal, and though they are usually packed to the rafters, the turn over seems to be quite quick, so if you hover, you generally don't have to wait long for a seat to pop up.\n\nPlus, as Shae M's review tipped me off to: they have cold brew on tap! Now, I may not know my coffee, but I know I ADORE good cold brew, so this was an added bonus.\n\nAll in all, I can't tell you the ins and outs of their brew, I won't wax poetic about their flat whites and I don't wear a \"coffee expert\" badge... but what I can tell you is this place is the perfect spot to pull up a chair, have a chat and sip something nice.

I was in a rush, so I just opted for a take away snack in the shape of a cannelloni bean and salad baguette and a Long Black.\n\nAs seems to be the trend in coffee start-ups these days, the décor has a grungy can't-be-bothered-to-decorate feel to it, with no particular design scheme in mind other than 'what furnishings can we get in the nearest second-hand shop?' I guess it's OK if you're a student as your own flat probably looks identical, but I'd prefer that there was at least some attempt at a coherent design scheme.\n\nAnyway, how about the coffee? Well, the Long Black was certainly the best I've had in this part of town; a really nice flavour to it and strong enough not to require me asking for an additional shot. However I thought the quantity could have been better. Maybe it was unfair of me to ask them to put it in my Yelp flask, but it would have been nice if they had mentioned that I would need two Long Blacks to adequately fill the flask, or offered something else like a grande Americano or something. Still, they did give me a discount of 23p for using my own container.\n\nThe baguette was OK if a little crunchy, but the bean filling wasn't particularly flavoursome.\n\nSo although the coffee was good, the higher prices here and the lacklustre sandwich prevent me giving it the full 5 stars. I'll try the coffee again at a future date, but for value (and the fact that they will fill my Yelp flask!), my favourite will remain Caffe Nero for now.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The review by Brett W. didn't sound too promising, and so I went with an open mind but pretty low expectations.\n\nI arrived late because of work commitments and the first thing that hit me was how lovely the décor was. To be honest, the exterior leaves a lot to be desired, as do loads of places on this street, but the interior really surpassed itself. The dimmed lighting really complimented the wooden clad walls, the leather chairs and unique art pieces really add an element of class to the place, without being tacky or OTT.\n\nWe were seated quite far back in the restaurant, and it was reasonably busy at the time. However, the waiter who took the drinks order was the same waiter who served us all night, which to me is a sign of a well organised establishment. He was polite and helpful, without being overbearing or pushy.\n\nThe menu was lengthy but very comprehensive, although I already knew what I was going to order. The Thai Pad prawn had come highly recommended from a work mate who had been to the restaurant only a few weeks earlier, and being a huge fan of prawns and Tamarind, which I had tasted at a Thai themed dinner about a month ago, I knew this was the right choice for me. Another member of the dinner party had the Thai Pad chicken dish, which sounded equally as delicious. \n\nWhen my meal came out I was very happy with the way it was presented and served, and came with noodles as part of the dish. The prawns were large and juicy, and the sauce had a sweet and tangy taste cut through with a peanutty flavour which was lovely. The flat noodles were slightly soft for my taste but it certainly didn't tarnish the dish. I washed it all down with a glass of house white which was quite nice.\n\nWe opted out of deserts although if I could have fitted anything else in I would have loved to have tried the Sang Ka Ya, a coconut custard which is green! I didn't actually pay for anything so I'm not sure how much the meal for 5 came to, but we shared a selection of small starters, and my main course was a very reasonable £9.50, which I was impressed with. I had heard loads of comments about how expensive the place was, but the real expense only seemed to come in if you ordered very authentic Thai dishes, which I hear are not for the faint hearted....lots of chillis!\n\nI would certainly recommend the place, and I will definitely be back again.

Wishful thinking perhaps, but it did pique my interest. That said, when my American-as-apple-pie parents came into town, I began exploring my options for an afternoon tea for all of us (it seems the thing to do!). Because of the timing, and my inability to muster up the gumption to put on some proper \"nice-ish\" clothes and venture into a place like the Waldorf Astoria, I decided to take a chance and drag my folks to Clarinda's.\n\nI'm quite happy with that decision all around. While Clarinda's doesn't offer the whole afternoon tea per se, they do offer a cream tea, which is tea accompanied by a scone with jam and cream, which works just as well, so you're not stuffed to the rafters full of sweets by the end. The place itself is full of kitschy glory--china plates hung all around the wall, a portrait of Rabbie Burns (naturally), info on Clarinda, supposedly a lady love of his at one point, and all of the floral wallpapering you could ever hope to see in a lifetime. It's charmingly cozy inside and all the flowers on the tables are fresh and pretty, and we were able to be sat as soon as we arrived. Our service was almost a little too prompt--our server kept returning several times while we struggled to peruse one menu between all three of us, until I requested a second menu, and we finally managed to place our order accordingly.\n\nWe all ended up ordering lunch along with cream tea for my parents, and a huge, gooey chocolate cake slice for me. I was impressed by the presentation of my parents simple sandwiches--it seriously kicks it up a notch when they look better than you've seen at some proper eatin' establishments. I'd give it a solid Clarissa seal of approval: the food and tea were nice; the service was good; the decor was lovely; the sweet treats were yum. \n\nAll in all, Clarinda's is a lovely and laid-back tea experience. I could see myself returning as a treat to myself in the future for sure, but even if I don't, I know my parents definitely enjoyed the experience!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

It was a nice shop and has a great deal of potential, I just wish there was a greater selection. I've not been back since that first visit - partly because I had a feeling it would be the same stock and partly because I know I would spend more money if I did, but I peer in the window now and again to keep an eye out.

What are you doing?! \n\nA pinxos bar in Edinburgh has had me on the edge of my seat for a while now. Finally, it opens and finally we get a chance to try it. \n\nMeh.\n\nI had such high hopes and maybe that was their undoing. We went for a wee breakfast, being a fan of the idea of a cortado with some churros (no chocolate for me thanks) and maybe some nice baguette bread with some ham and cheese. That breakfast just screams 'set up for the day'! Luckily their Facebook page had shown a picture the previous day of a fairly attractive lookin' breakfast type roll, with Serrano, manchego and a coffee. I sent the pic to the OH and we decided we wanted a slice of that!\n\nThe next morning we headed around. The first issue that arose was the tables. The OH was never going to fit anywhere near these. He's a big lad (tall, not wide) and had no chance between the tiny seats and tiny tables. These tables and chairs are probably more suited to the evening for a platter-esque dining experience. Not for a cosy brekkie. \n\nI asked at the bar about these breakfast rolls (they weren't on the menu) and was told they had no idea what I was talking about. A long explanation ensued before they understood and even when the girl from the till was relaying my request the chef guy seemed confused. \n\nWe then went with cappuccinos and a portion of churros between us. Everything arrived in a timely manner. They had however misunderstood and one roll arrived with cheese the other with ham. We swapped insides to mix it up and the OH resolved to get a roll from Greg's on the way home as this was not going to fill him! \n\nThe coffee was delicious and the churros were the best I've had in Edinburgh, without a doubt. Still gooeyish inside and perfectly crispy outside with a sprinkling of sugar. I am literally smacking my lips thinking about them. \n\nThe decor is wonderful, I like the logo and the colour scheme they've gone for. The exposed brick and metal cupboards (?) look great! I was especially taken in with the counter as everything is in view. Very Barcelona! \n\nThe staff seemed friendly, though inexplicably frazzled. There was few customers in but they were acting as if run off their feet!\n\nI'll definitely be back for a platter and to see if they have any cidre - the oddly bitter, strangely addictive Catalan cider- and I really hope I'll be able to bump this up.

Sadly my joy turned to ashes in my mouth after popping in. The food tastes great, that's not my problem. My problem is that the portion sizes are tiny. Minuscule. Micro bloody Scopic. \"What is this, dinner for ants?\" The prices have taken the opposite track. \n\nThey charge upwards of £3 for bread and aioli; three teardrops of garlic mayo and enough bread for maybe two people (if you're lucky). Every dish is saucy, so if you want to make the most of it I'm afraid to say you'll be spending at least a tenner on bread baskets. \n\nAs for the rest. The patatas bravas were like nothing I've ever seen before: like one medium sized tattie was diced into tiny cubes in an experiment to see how small one could cube a potato. I've lived in Sevilla and Valencia and spent plenty of time in other Spanish cities. I've never seen bravas that small. \n\nAnd it wasn't just the bravas. Every tapa was a tiny saucer of food (an appetiser really) with prices to rival a substantial starter in any other restaurant on the Walk. Bear in mind this isn't some posh Michelin star offering; it's a relaxed tapas bar.\n\nWhen you find yourself spending £20+ (at least!) per head, and are still hankering for a pizza on the way home, you know the job's a bad 'un.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Or, underwhelming. You get the idea. I so wanted it to be amazing, but it just wasn't and it could be and should be.\n\nI've gone for 3 stars as I feel it's a compromise between what Serrano Manchego has got right, and what it's got wrong. The décor alone warrants a solid 4, verging on to 5. The service and the food are definitely a 2 (\"meh, I've experienced better\", I couldn't have said it better myself!).\n\nI'm going to start with the good. The place looks fantastic. It's all exposed brick and wood with the logo stencilled on the wall. Lovely. Lots of space and tables. A definite thumbs up on this. And I love the concept, a Spanish pincho bar on Leith Walk. Only one beer on draught (Alhambra), bite sized snacks and platters, signature croquettas, great! And erm. That's the good. The décor and the concept.\n\nThe bad? Well I'll start with the service. I'm probably not being fair, as yesterday was their opening night (although as stated on their Facebook page this wasn't a soft opening, it wasn't an exclusive party, it was just open), but given the amount of time they've spent into decorating and sourcing ingredients, they really ought to have trained their staff! I'd be surprised if any of the bar staff\/servers has worked in a bar or a restaurant before. Not one of them knew how to pour a pint, so the manager had to teach them on the job, and of course this meant that it took ages to get served (and what's with ringing up a transaction on the sole till before pouring the drinks?). And if you'd ordered food you got a numbered wooden spoon in a glass, fairly standard. But the poor girls serving spent most of the evening wandering about in a daze looking for whoever had ordered that particular dish... The staff were all perfectly nice, they were just all woefully inexperienced. I ought to point out that I was with my boyfriend and sister, both experienced bar staff and servers, so as you can imagine we had little tolerance, but even if I'd been there alone I'd still have been frustrated.\n\nAnd the food, oh the food. A great concept doesn't make up for poor execution. There's a nice sounding selection of cold and hot pinchos, as well as tostados, platters and the croquettas of the day. I don't know if this will always be the case, but they only had one croquette on yesterday, which was haggis. Or was it? I was definitely told it was haggis, but biting into it you'd never have known. Sure, the herbs and spices tasted a little like our national dish, but the texture was creamy and the colour was pale and the taste was bland. What was it?! We also ordered a dish of olives. What we got was a small plate (not a bowl, which would have made more sense), of pitted olives that looked and tasted like they'd come straight from a jar. I don't buy jarred olives at the supermarket, I don't expect to be served them in a bar. And pitted, who serves pitted olives?!\n\nI'd like to say everyone else's food look great, but judging by the table next to us that isn't the case. They'd ordered a platter of manchego, blue cheese, walnuts, quince and raisins that came with no blue cheese. There was an explanation for this, but I didn't catch it, and given they'd only been open for 3 hours at this point I sincerely hope they hadn't run out. Then came the tostados, or bread with a topping. Standard, I know, and I wasn't expecting anything brilliant from a basic open sandwich, but they just looked so uninspiring. Fortunately none of the food is expensive.\n\nI actually feel annoyed about it all. I wanted Serrano Manchego to be brilliant. They've had a great Facebook presence and I know I wasn't the only local eagerly awaiting its opening, and it was packed last night. I want to give them a second chance, because I truly believe that they could be great if only they improve. Please guys, the problems I've identified should be easy to fix! I really hope that in a couple of months time I'll be writing an updated review of 4 or 5 stars.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I shared a pot with a friend which set us back a little over £2.

It might be cool if you are of chatty and adventurous nature, but not when you try and catch up stories with a friend you have not seen for ages!\n\n2. The cream tea is simple and you are not getting much of it, just the spare minimum. nothing special. 1 scone, whipped cream, jam and tea. Ok the price is £3.60 for the cream tea, but if you I would have a choice, I would prefer a bit more creativity.\n\n3. The cakes were laid out on a table for people to look at and choose from. No self service so. They looked a bit try to me. Not sure if its the fact that the items potentially might be displayed  for a whole day.\n\n4. My friend got additional goods she had not ordered, but still needed to pay for.

What does explain it, and the fact that the place was already almost packed when we arrived, follows:\n\nMighty fine quiche lorraine, warm and solid, served with crisps and a simple yet effective salad, for the un-wince-worthy sum of £5.50; tea for two, served in a cuddly bulbous teapot blooming with roses (I believe I have mentioned my love of roses in other reviews); dazzlingly swift service; cakes from just £1.75; cheery atmosphere.\n\nExplanation served!

However, the class of shows at Assembly always seems to be that little bit better.\n\n\n During the Fringe there are a number of bars and cafes on site which provide somewhat over-priced drinks to a captive audience!

I ordered an OTR jacket, two ties and a shirt. I was quite excited, as that is a significant order for me. The goods arrived extremely quickly, but unfortunately, the jacket was almost wearable but just too tight, and the shirt was unwearable for the same reason. I took the jacket to a good tailor, and there was almost insufficient cloth at the seams to slightly enlarge it. However, he was able to just make it about an inch larger in the body, so it fits nicely; i better not gain weight, though! The tailor said this is a slim fit, and they should have told you their clothes are cut that way. Incidentally, he is from Turkey, so he is acclimated to European tailoring. I returned the shirt, got a replacement in a size I requested, and it was sloppy large. I'm now in the process of exchanging that one for a size between the two I've gotten that didn't work.\n\nIf this souds like a saga, I'm not even telling half of it! Throughout this whole ordeal, the Walker-Slater person helping me was thoroughly patient, professional, and personable. They responded promptly to my MANY emails, and they are now providing me with complimentary shipping for my return of the present shirt and the second new one they are sending to me. This complimentary shipping is saving me a bundle. This latter service was totally unexpected and they would have totally been within their rights to charge me. Also, I did not request complimentary shipping one way, let alone both ways; they did this on their own.\n\nSo, in sum, be forewarned that many of the clothes are cut quite trim. As I am older and American, some of this is due to age, not being as well propotioned as I once was, and my not being used to European cuts. But, for example, I measure 15-1\/2 neck, and that's what I ordered for the shirt in my original order. I couldn't even close the top collar button. But also know, if you have a problem, I don't think you'll be left unhappy. In this day and age, especially with internet orders, that is wonderful comfort. Oh, and I wouldn't have gone through all this if I didn't love the clothing.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

And so when WHISKI Rooms opened up on the Mound, and I passed it day on day with all that liquid sunshine beaming out at me, I knew it wouldn't be long before I stopped in here to sample what was on offer.\n\nThe boy and I came here for a Friday evening meal. It was a lovely sunny evening and around 7.30 the place was almost full but had a really nice relaxed ambience about it, rather than rushed.\n\nI had a craving for seafood, but didn't fancy the salmon in the mains section so asked if it was possible to have the scallops starter as a main. All they did was double up the portion size, and price, equally but this suited me fine. The boy had the soup and then the burger.\n\nThe scallops, served on black pudding, were really quite delicious. The scallops were beautifully cooked and the contrast of the crispy black pudding was just mmm. It looked like a fairly small portion (despite being doubled) - it was 6 scallops in total. But I had it with a side of the seasonal veg and struggled to finish it all. The seasonal veg was also really nicely cooked - shredded cabbage and carrots, neither covered in butter or dried out - just right.\n\nThe boy's soup was, I have to say, a little bland. But hey, you win some you lose some. Despite being a creamy soup it just lacked much flavour. His burger was epic, a giant hand-made beast with bacon and a delicious WHISKI sauce and onion relish. As far as burgers go, it was good. The chips, I am told, were a little meh. (The burger + chip combo is an important one.)\n\nNow, the drinks. The cocktail list has a whole page (or more) dedicated to whisky cocktails. Oh yes. My favourite cocktail is a margarita. And what did they have? A whisky-rita. That's right, a margarita made with whisky. It even came in a margarita glass, salt-rimmed. I have to say a margarita with tequila is still better for this combination BUT I really enjoyed it and loved the ingenuinty and cheeky take on it. The whisky sour I had after was one of the better ones I've had in the city too.\n\nYou need to ask for the whisky menu itself, as this isn't provided as standard on the table. But when you do be prepared to get those reading glasses out. It's very long, in very small print. I'd guess at least over 100 whiskies. The boy was happy. And the one he ordered, a new Islay one we hadn't tried yet (Aird Bheag) hit the spot nicely.\n\nThe staff were really friendly, and the waitress and I had a wee laugh when she came to ask about my order just as I was taking a sample bite of the boys burger, which as I said was epic. Friendly, familiar and down-to-earth but still very attentive.\n\nOH! I forgot to mention the chocolate mousse. A really generous serving, really quite dense and rich which was looovellly although we were both really full from our mains.\n\nI had a really nice evening here for a relaxed post-work dinner. You could definitely rock up here straight after work and enjoy a nice meal without feeling under-dressed but it's also got some class. Due to its location and the fact its called WHISKI, serving whisky, in the capital of Scotland (whisky land) I can tell it's going to be mobbed during August. But it'll be nice to re-claim it as a local in the winter.","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

Went with a few friends for a tasting event on a Saturday evening and now see this as a beautiful staple to bring any future visitors to - highly recommend a visit to this spot for any budding whisky fans!! The four whiskies provided gave us a great range of tastes, building slowly from a relatively easily drinkable whiskey from the lowlands, up through to some of the more peety\/ smoky whiskies from the islands and highlands. The cheese pairings with the whiskies were delicious and incredibly well done. I'm mildly cheese obsessed, so potentially a bit biased, but beyond just giving us some great new local cheeses (highlight was one called \"old smokey\" - if you ever see this in a store, please buy it, try it, and then come back down from your visit to heaven and let me know where to find it!), each one truly did bring something wonderful and new to the whisky it was paired with!\n\nOur guide was personable and knowledgeable - he gave us lots of information throughout the tasting but was also open and happy to answer any questions. He was unpretentious and thankfully didn't attempt to influence our tasting by saying things like \"you'll get notes of cinnamon on the nose, and honeysuckle on the palette\" - he simply guided us through the process of drinking whisky, allowing us to get the most from the experience, reminding us throughout that each of us is different, and as such will experience each whisky differently.\n\nI went to this tasting event with three friends, and we went through the experience with around 12 other people at a long beautiful wood table. I loved that the decor and vibe of the place was very much in keeping with the whisky culture. A few of those I was with had been to the Whisky Experience previously (another whisky tour option in Edinburgh), and mentioned that the Whiski Rooms tasting was far better done, so go for this one if given the choice!\n\nNote that I didn't eat here so can't say anything regarding the food - this rating is solely in regards to their whisky and cheese tasting events (which are offered regularly).\n\nThe whole tasting cost all of about £25, which I can happily say was beyond worth it. You also get £5 off any bottle purchase afterwards (which they fortunately don't push you at all into using - they're all happy to help but not aggressive salesmen!). You could look at it from the perspective of \"I could get a lot more than 4 drams of whisky and 8 hunks of cheese for that kind of money,\" but I promise it's worth it - you'll never drink whisky the same way again after this tasting!!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I went for the haddock which was delicious and meaty.\n\nHaving tried this place on a chance the gamble paid off and I'd definitely come here again.

And then, it took at least another 10 minutes before they'd come back to take your order.\n\nWe didn't here for food, so I can't vouch fo the food. But they do have nice whiskey\/scotch flights. I highly recommend the flight that allows you to taste a scotch from each region of Scotland. It's a great way to really taste and learn the differences between the various types of scotch.  If you can get a seat by the front window, especially in the winter when there are no leaves on the trees, you'll end up with a really nice view over the princes street gardens.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This was the only blip during my holiday in Scotland, so I'm going to get these thoughts out of the way and then pretend it never happened. \n\nWe stopped because there wasn't a wait - maybe that should have been a sign. We quickly realized that very recently this place had changed hands (i.e. the wine menus were from the former restaurant), and they were still figuring things out. Our server was rude and dismissive, but that was because he was trying to manage serving all the tables in the front end of the restaurant while acting as the host to the steady stream of people coming in (bank holiday weekend, so it was buuuusssssssy). I get it. But still. \n\nThe food and drink?\n- My glass of valpolicello was FILLED with sediment - I've actually never experienced this at a restaurant before; it was a huge turnoff. \n- I asked for a side of olives (something not on their menu alone currently), and out came a huge portion of pre-pitted generic green and black olives. They were flavorless and very soggy. \n- I got the linguini with tomato sauce... Plentiful, yes. Flavorful, no. The sauce was soupy and the pasta was a bit limp. \n- Tried a bite of the garlic bread (a big disc of it; it looked like it could be a pizza crust) and it was a bit too cardboardy for my likes. \n\nBut...to their credit, I'm full. And I no longer crave Italian.\n\nHowever, I am also wondering why I didn't just run over to Sainsbury's and make some spaghetti myself.","useful":8,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Michael's Steak & Seafood came to mind after i'd read a number of good reviews on yelp and tripadvisor, so we booked a table for the saturday night.\n\nwe arrived a bit early for our table reservation but were shown to a table right away.  this was in the window right next to a flight of stairs and a bit out of the main body of the restaurant.  it felt a bit isolated so we asked to move which was accommodated to a better seat in the middle of the restaurant.  i know the idea was to put us in the window and make the restaurant look busier, but as there were free tables in better locations i was a bit annoyed they did this.  but they moved us without a hassle so that was fair enough.\n\nthe menu is true to the name- steaks and seafood are to the fore for both starters and mains.  i went with a smoked haddock and saffron potato terrine to start and the sirlion steak with chimichurri sauce for my main.  the boyfriend had the queenie scallops to start followed by the rib eye steak with peppercorn sauce for a main.  starters arrived quickly, pretty much just after we got our bottle of wine.  my terrine was good without being amazing and the queenie scallops while good were a fairly small portion for the prize.  the starter plates were only just cleared away before our steaks arrived for a main, so a bit of a rush through the meal which i hate.  but the steak was cooked well and had a nice beefy taste.  my chimichurri sauce was quite good but that wasn't a lot of it sadly.  i think the best part was my boyfriend's sauteed potatoes that were really moreish with the steaks solidly average.\n\nwe were offered dessert menus which we looked over and took some time to drink our wine as the whole meal so far had only been over the space of just barely an hour.  we opted for a sticky toffee pudding and walnut, almond, and caramel tart to end with amaretto liquer coffees to follow.  the sticky toffee pudding was really quite good.  my tart was not quiet what i expected being a pastry base filled with whole nuts mixed in a caramel type sauce.  it was ok but nothing more.  the amaretto coffees were quite good though.\n\nso overall i was left a little underwhelmed with Michael's Steak & Seafood.  it was not the romantic dinner we'd hoped for on our anniversary night and the fact we had three courses, wine, and coffee we were only there for an hour and a half.  the timing of each course felt quite rushed and i didn't really feel like i could sit and enjoy my dinner.  they didn't need our table back so i'm not sure why everything was served so fast.  the staff are friendly though and the price is fairly reasonable but with so many options in edinburgh i don't think i'll be back.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Still, we pulled up to a low table and decided to make the best of it.  Milk is a very cute little cafe where they make everything fresh, and it's a very cosy place to spend an afternoon.  I had a pot of peppermint tea while my fiancé had a latte, and I eventually ordered poached eggs on chunky bread with spinach salad, which came with a juice.  I think we got the lemon and ginger juice (or was it lime and mint??) but either way it was so refreshing and lovely.  The eggs were just perfect, and the thick bread underneath was just gorgeous.  A big, hearty piece from an artisan loaf.  Spinach was lightly dressed with a tangy dressing.  A simple breakfast, but very well made.  My fiancé got the slow-roasted pork wrap in flatbread with herbs and slaw, which was nice of them to make since it wasn't on the special menu that day but he'd been looking forward to having it.  We both enjoyed it, the meat did have a nice flavor, but he found the wrap too small and not quite as good as he'd hoped.  He had to grab a healthy little carrot-nut muffin (which was quite scrumptious) to-go afterwards since he wasn't full up!\n\nIt's a bit out of the way, but they have such a cool cafe menu.  Great stop if you're on the way to the Modern Art Gallery and want something cheap, cheerful, and homemade.  Very friendly staff as well, though there aren't many of them and it can take quite a while to get your food and drinks on a busy day.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Actually integrated into the offerings, as if it's perfectly normal to want some vegetable content.  Wonderful!\n\nMind you, the carnivorous options were pretty good, too....I was severely tempted by the Moroccon stew....in fact, I'm having a little lunch-time fantasy about that right now...\n\nOn the occassion I visited Milk, though, I had ducked in to avoid any further drenching and found the staff a little distracted, sorting various logistical things that must have been important, but overall, were pleasant and helpful.\n\nI ordered the butternut squash soup, which came with bread so light and airy it was like eating a cloud.  The soup was thick and definitely home-made, a good comfort meal even if I wasn't 100% sold on the combination of roasted garlic garnish - it was just a little too sweet\/startling to the tastebuds in a not-so-smooth way to be perfect.  But, having said that, it was still tasty enough that I managed to get my spoon to scrape noisily on the bottom of the bowl!\n\nAfter half an hour or so of pleasant working, I also ordered a latte and carrot cake.  The latte?  Frikkin perfect.  The cake?  Substantial and light at the same time, and filled with nuts and fruit and wonderful things that one wouldn't necessarily expect in carrot cake.  Delicious although, again, the lemon and vanilla icing will surprise tastebuds indoctrinated to expect cream cheese icing!  (But in a good way!)\n\nAll in all, an excellent first experience.  I will definitely be making regular appearances at Milk, in order to try the Mull Cheddar with Pear and Ginger chutney, Harissa chicken and other delights.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

The café is a little off the city centre, but still has an acceptable and nice location (for me, nice location means quite easy to find it via google map as I'm a map idiot). From the outside, it has quite lovely and idyllic wooden arch. Since Christmas is approaching, the arch has lighting decoration, giving impressive to the passerby. Once entering the café, I noticed that there are only three customers who looked like regular-visit ones. Although neither the only waitress nor the female owner said welcome or hello to me, I didn't mind it too much. After sitting down, the waitress came to give me menu and just walked away to do her task. The restaurant-like menu has first page of dishes of the day and normal dishes serving everyday coming after that. Although there are only four or give vegetarian and vegan dishes respectively, they all look simple but refresh. I ordered hummus of the day - red chili hummus with warm pitta bread and side salad (5.5 pounds, a little pricy at first glance for me). \n\nIt did not take too long to have hummus served. Hummus is served in a small jar, with pieces of pitta bread and side salad on each side on a rectangular plate. The red chili hummus tastes nice and not spicy at all, but I would expect it could have flavor of red chili. In comparison to hummus, I was impressed by its side salad honestly due to its honey mustard dressing. The dressing seems like home-made, and I think it is the best salad dressing I have had in Edinburgh. It tastes not strong and greasy, quite fresh with little sweetness. The pitta bread is so-so, maybe too soft and not warm enough. Personally I love chewy warm pitta bread accompanied with cold hummus in cold weathers because it not only keeps you stomach warm but also enrich the taste of hummus. \n\nGenerally, I would recommend café nom de plume for vegetarian friends and nacho lovers. The café actually is more famous for its nachos due to its special cheese topping on the nachos. Maybe next time I will try its main dish to see whether it's truly on my regular-visit restaurant list. I'll wait and see.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Firstly as Cafe Nexus around 1999 (or was it Nexus Cafe) I am sure someone will correct me. The lovely Fiona served fantastic bacon rolls.

Sala was aTapas bar and it was that iteration I enjoyed most. Minimal decoration with brown basic furniture. Just what you would expect to find in a quiet side street in Barcelona. Jo made a huge amount of improvements to the kitchen and installed a nice bar which still exists. Good planning Jo, it can't be bettered. I met one of my best friends here, Pam Smith, or The Palmster to her friends. She turned me from a grumpy old man who sat in the corner reading his paper into someone with, perhaps, a few more social skills! Jo moved on and Sala was run by David and Joe for a short period eventually bought by Colin and Alan and changed to Nom de Plume. As stated in previous posts it's just like coming into someone's living room with an eclectic mix of props and decorations. The staff are friendly, good choice of wine, beer, cider and it serves Hendricks Gin. A favourite of mine. A varied menu with snacks if you want to eat cheaply.

As far as independent\/arthouse cinemas go, the Cameo has a couple of nice tricks up its sleeve. First is the membership which will set you back £30 a year but gives you discounted rates on tickets as well as concessions and also includes three free tickets to any movie or your choice (which goes some way to discounting the membership price.\n\nThe second thing the Cameo has up its sleeve are the double bill Sundays where they'll show two semi related movies back to back; the first usually being a recent movie which is nearing the end of its run and the second something vaguely related to the first (for example today they showed Machete followed by Planet Terror). The good news with these double bills is that they're the price of a regular ticket OR free if you're a member (again knocking a few quid off of that ticket price). There's no obligation to stay through both and it can be a good way of killing a lazy Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe final thing that the Cameo has up its sleeve is a bit of personality. They'll happily show films from a while ago, just because and the staff are all friendly enough. There's a nice cafe\/bar attached to the side and in general it's a pretty good place to see a little something hich isn't showing at the multiplexes.\n\nThe bad?

Cinema one is how I imagine all cinemas to have been in days gone by; plush red velvet seats, ornate pillars and high ceillings. The other two screens are smaller and more intimate, but still provide a good viewing experience. The cinema shows a good mix of films, with some big releases and some more obscure independent offerings. The sunday double bill is free for members and is a great way to spend a hungover afternoon, there's also an excellent bar that allows you to take drinks into the films (hurrah!). The toilets downstairs are in need of renovation, but I believe this is planned for the future once the funds have been raised.\n\nThis place is a gem in a city full of soulless multiplexes.

As a result, I tend to look at smaller, less appreciated cinemas with a sense of fondness, cinema's like the Cameo in Tolcross.\nOk, it doesn't look like much but the 50s style 'Now Showing' board at the front adds character for what it lacks in structure.

It's been an independent cinema since the 50s and plays a huge role in the Edinburgh Film Festival.\n\nCinemas that have remained unscathed since the arrival of the multiplex get my vote any day of the week, and with its old seats and embellished interior design on the ceiling, it truly is a window into cinema culture of the past. But what makes me respect this cinema infinitely more is the fact they are now running showings of The Room, which in case you didn't know is a cult classic because it's so crap. It's built up a following of Rocky Horror proportions and is best watched in a setting like this since audience participation is apparently something to behold. It's next showing on the 31st and I would urge you to go watch it - it has to be seen to be believed.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I can remember the location for the bar being several terrible meat market style pubs and so it was pleasing to see that there had been a mini makeover that had turned the slutty girl from high school into a fairly cool young woman but you could still see the signs of the past misdemeanours.\n\nFirstly, they've done what you would expect, a changing supply of quality beers on draught which is going to challenge the nearby Brewdog. Holyrood 9a also has a great reputation for its food and its here that Ox184 loses a mark on its older (and slightly more cooler) brother. I had a snack from the Lights menu which was a Chorizo Flat bread, it came out on nice looking wood plate that dwarfed the food on it - it wasn't even a full flat bread. It was an odd combination of warmed chorizo and not quite cooked cheese, certainly not the quality I usually get from the Holyrood bar.\n\nThe guys serving were really attentive and pleasant and do make the bar stand out from the nearby opposition of Brewdogs \"too cool for skool' atmosphere or the 'can't be bothered to care' staff at Three Sisters so will carve out a little niche for themselves. \n\nIt's good to see the Cowgate getting another quality bar but it needs a bit of a tweak in the food offering to come up to the class of its older brother down the road.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

On my bus we were told that the tickets when we arrived for the Loch Ness and castle tours would be either 14\/26 pounds depending on the tour you chose. However another bus paid their driver 13\/18 (a huge difference for the more expensive tour, and a lot of us would have done it had we known). We tried to ask our guide if she was sure that was the price but when we went to the ticket stand, the student price was 13\/19.80 and the adult price was 14\/21.

That's the nature of a touristy company though. \nThere's a lot of folklore and music info on the bus, and the people I talked to on the other buses really loved their guides and experiences, although on my bus it was just so-so. If you don't have a better way to get out to all the historic locations or if you have a limited amount of time to get a lot done, a tour is a great way to go.

We had a pretty good time considering we usually don't like guided tours.  But for a short trip, this tour provided us a leisure, no-brainer, no planning but cover a lot of ground to see places we otherwise would not be able to see in our short trip.\n\nOur tour guide has been doing this for very many years, who is very knowledgeable and funny at times.  He is a no-sugar coated straight talker who gives somewhat of \"soup nazi\" kinda vibe.  First, there is no food or drink to be consumed on the bus.  Then, it's if you are late, you can wave 'bye bye' as the bus drives away.  Which, I actually like that.  I rather not spend precious time waiting for peeps not respecting other people's time.  So again, we did enjoy the tour.\n\nSome important notes and cautions:\n1) It pays to get there a little early to be the first ones on the bus.  This is so you can pick a seat with the large window (without a pillar) to have a great few of the drive.  This is critical cause you will be stuck in those seats throughout the tour regardless of the various stops.\n\n2) The breakfast joint\/stop is jacked up in price... the worst I've seen.  Like... 3£ for ONE average sized single pancake that ain't even that great.  So, best to come with a full tummy or pack your own.  Though if you did pack your own, you can't sit at any of the establishment's tables.  The lunch joint\/stop isn't so bad.  You can get 'chippey' (fish & chips) for about 8£ and they tasted really good.\n\n3) Lastly, (which is also my main irritation with this tour), when the brochure says \"Optional Extras\" of Urquhart Castle & Loch Ness Cruise, the reality of it is, it's really not an option.  I wish they had disclosed it, but it was a bit shady how it was presented.  When we booked it, the lady said those are optional, if you don't want to do the cruise you don't have to.  Which made it sound like you could still go to the castle, just not do the cruise (and we were giving different pricing of castle only, tour and castle, etc).\n\nBut when we were on the bus, the tour guide basically says he STRONGLY recommends everyone take the castle AND cruise.  The deal is, he will drop everyone off at the castle location.  You have about 1.5 hr to look at the castle before having to take the cruise to meet him at the pick up point.  So the drop off and pick up places are different.  This means that If you DON'T pick the cruise, you are to stay on the bus with him to go to the pick up point (and can't see the castle), which is just a hotel and you sit there to look at the gift shop and drink coffee at the coffee shop, cause he is not going to pick you up at the castle.\n\nIt may have been that he is trying to save some day light time cause our tour was in the winter, but the shady way really didn't sit well with us.  When we booked the tour, the lady gave us different prices for the optional tour (i.e. Castle & Cruise for 16£, Castle only is something less... I forgot).  But there really wasn't an option.  You wouldn't sit in a bus for 4 hours just to sit at a cafe and drink coffee... or I assume that wouldn't be normal.... \n\nAnyways, so the tour, though priced at 40£, in my opinion, is really 56£.  Would we have done the tour at 56£?  Yes, I think we would.  And it wouldn't irk us so much if the tour description were to say \"entry fee to castle and cruise included\".  But I guess they felt the extra 16£ would turn away too many potential customers.... \n\nOh, and the 5 star cruise... eh... it's a short ferry trip on a boat with pre-recorded tour message and a bar.... I guess the bar makes it 5 stars?!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Yes it is very tourist- orientated (they even take you to a penned up highland cow as well as a number of touristy gift shops along the way), but it was great fun, our guide was great and there were plenty of stops for a breather and toilet.\n If you are going to do this particular tour I would strongly suggest that you pack your own lunch instead of eating at the overpriced(and not very good) diner they take you and once you do get to Loch Ness, not to pay to go in to the ruins of the castle but to go straight on to the boat tour(you can see most of the castle from there anyway). \n\nAs for the price, I thought it was very expensive despite the 2pounds off we got as students. The price does not include the boat tour of Loch Ness which is a bit annoying.

He even made \"extra\" stops at Doune Castle, different lochs on our way up into the Highlands, and to see the Highland Cows! Amazing tour and definitely worth the price!

While it's not entirely their fault, I still would never use this company again, and I would deter everyone I knew from doing business with them. Let me explain. \n\nWe missed our Saturday tour due to an awful hotel with no phone, no wake up call, and no functioning cell phone to set an alarm. Our American phones don't work in Europe. \n\nOur scheduled time to meet was at 8 am. When I woke up at 7:50 am I panicked, and called the number provided. I was assured that we would just be able to switch on to Sundays tour instead, and I was very satisfied. They simply told me to call back at 8 pm to verify they had enough people. Of course I asked, and 6 is the amount of people they need to have a tour. \n\nI call at 8 pm, and the tour is canceled. Apparently, they only had 4 people (besides my two) who had booked the tour. So instead of counting us as the extra two, they canceled the tour. Completely leaving 6 people who wanted a tour of the Lochs high and dry. Which means stranded, I'm not sure that phrase crossed the pond. \n\nTo add insult to injury, they refuse to refund our money. Even though they had the necessary 6 people they needed. So, Timberbush kept our 140 sterling pounds, and did not show us anything. And left 4 other people to find another tour at the last minute. \n\nMiraculously, we find another tour through our awful hotel and set off to see the Lochs and Glens Sunday morning, just like Timberbush had promised, but through the eyes of another  tour group, which turned out to be fantastic.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We had a girl from Taiwan joining our tour and she was not on the \"list\", such there were a few problems already at the start of her trip. Needless to say the bus was full and she was offered the chair beside the driver, which is a pain and uncomfortable. Also, Sky accommodation can be booked out at this time of the year and it is really hard to get a last minute accommodation. Luckily she was able to stay in the Youth Hostel, which was arranged last minute by Timberbush to help her joining the tour. \n\nTalking about accommodation. I also had a few irregularities\/confusion with my requests and booking and ended up in a B&B on Sky, which was located a bit outside of town. I noticed that it only took me a 20 min walk to get from and to town, so the distance would have been still acceptable, if it was not necessarily raining. I think there are about 3 taxis in that village :-). Having said this, the hostel is located in the middle of town and better accessible. It depends on what you like and are comfortable with.\nWe were 30 people on the bus and all of us were dropped of at different locations, which were arranged by Timberbush. The booking team appears very helpful and at the same time it also seems you have no say at all about what you want.\n\nThe tour lasted 3 days and it felt a bit hurried and a lot of driving and sightseeing cramped into a 24h day. On-Off, on-off,on-off...hardly any toilet breaks, only when we were allowed to.\nJust make sure you go to the toilet when the bus stops, otherwise you might have no opportunity for a period of time until the next break.\nWe stopped at a lot of the major sightseeing locations! All the decisions of additional locations were unanimously discussed and agreed to by the group.\n\nSites we visited: Pit stop Loch Lommond, Glencoe Leven Hotel for lunch (lovely location of the hotel), a viewpoint onto the three sisters mountain range, Glenfinnan Monument and Viaduct with the \"Harry Potter Train\" approaching, Mallaig boat crossing onto Sky, Portree, Roundtrip on Sky - Old Man of Storr, Kilt Rock, Fiona MacDonalds grave, Dunvegan Castle (entry £10) - Eilean Donan Castle, Fort Augustus, a Waterfall, Blair Atholl Whisky Distillery.......\n\nThe bus offered some sort of comfort, but there was no opportunity to store anything infront of you. There is no pull down small table, no bin, no water holder.\n\nIn regards to prices and costs. The price you pay for the tour only includes the driver and the bus. For everything else you need to pay: accommodation and entrance fees, food......Yes, you get handed out a small bottle of the Grouse Scotch blended whisky! Not even something authentic in regards to the Scottish renowned Single Malt Whiskys.\nI think it would be beneficial if lunch and drinks could be arranged and provided by the tour provider and included in the price Why? Because, all that you do when being dropped of at a place is look for a toilet and look around for something to eat. This will take up all your time and there will be hardly any time left for a bit of sightseeing.\n\nOur driver Frank was also our tour guide and tried to inform us of various interesting facts about the Scottish History and the areas we visited. I really enjoyed his stories and knowledge. It was just a shame that he was driving whilst telling us about the gruesome past of the Highlanders. The driving interrupted his story telling flow as he also needed to \"think when driving\", not to mention that sometimes he drove quite fast and people in the bus where shaken in all directions.\nOn a good note Frank was very knowledgeable about the area and recommended a lot of good restaurants and things to explore. He was always forthcoming with certain requests and dropped you off at your accommodation to make sure you arrive at your \"place\" safely. Just make sure you are waiting for him 5 min earlier than he says he is picking you up :-)\n\nDining in Portree: Restaurant bookings are required - as early as possible - otherwise be happy with COOP food (which might be cheaper anyway). More tourists than dining possibilities. We managed to get a booking for a first class fish restaurant for the next day and the meal at the Harbour View Restaurant was delightful. I wish this restaurant would be in Edinburgh.\n\nAnother feedback from my fellow travelers was that for foreigners not everything was easy to understand, such they struggled a bit with translations and the speed of the stories.\n\nOverall the tour was okay, but I recommend it is better time spend on arranging a drive yourself and enjoy precious time where and what you want to see instead of being rushed. On the other hand the tour provider could introduce a 4 day tour with an additional stop when returning from the isle.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

You pay five pounds and thirty pence and five minutes later a perfectly sized box of delicious noodles arrive. You can eat in or out and it costs the same.

Those prawns, whoah. I knew I was having the prawns when I saw them. All big and juicy and fresh. Ok so the oyster sauce required me to dose about half a bottle of soy for flavour after, and there were far, far more noodles than vegetables but there were a decent number of prawns and it filled the hole.\n\nThe service was good too, they were happy enough to wait for me to run to a cash machine, no hassle there, and even though we stayed till 10ish on a Monday when they were obviously eager to leave (and go play football?) they weren't arsey about it at all, but instead just asked politely \"are you guys finished yeah?\"\n\nNoodly goodness. Prawny goodness. Goodness me. Yep I like Red Box and Red Box likes me.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Only half full at most, and that was 8pm Saturday night. Served straight away. Went for the beer box, and at first ot seemed a bit limiting to only have 3 veg and one main meat\/fish, but it turned out lovely. Had water chestnuts, peppers and one other veg which to my shame I can't recall, with extra ginger and garlic, all mixed up with thick udon noodles, and a spicy schezuan sauce, with shui mai dumplings for a starter, and a bottle of their house beer, though you could have had Asahi. All very pleasant, quick and good. From entering, we were all eating within ten minutes, and we all enjoyed it. Pretty good value at £9 a head.\nThe dumplings were a little salty, but I'd just had a cocktail, so they disappeared quickly. The main noodle dish was hot, filling and better than I would have made at home. It's not spectacular, and it's definitely aimed at Western tastes, but it's quick, good value, tasty and yes, they have those little boxes we've been watching American TV & film people eat out of for years.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Everyone I've brought here has fallen for Red-Box, just as I did, and comes back time and again. Even friends from out of town have clamoured for a trip to Red-Box at some point during their visit, and I'm pretty sure that's not simply to escape my notorious cooking. The variety of items on offer means that there's something for everyone, and you can either develop your own personal favourite or experiment with something new every trip, knowing it's going to be freshly cooked right from scratch there and then.\n\nThe concept behind Red-Box is simple but effective; along the lines of a Subway for noodles, customers pick their base (noodle type), key filling (meat) and extras (vegetables, sauce, and seasoning). Large signs near the entrance explain the process and different noodle types to beginners, and then you just head straight on in and compile your dream meal.\n\nBrilliantly located and never less than delicious food, this is a regular lunch-spot for me. The titular red box arrives at lightning speed just minutes after ordering (everything moves fast in this place, including the queue) and, TARDIS-like, contains piles more nosh than a conventional understanding of spatial dimensions ought to permit.\n\nFor those patrons choosing not to take away, the restaurant is clean and functional, although not particularly stylish in its minimalism and the stools can get little uncomfortable. The service is as one would might hope for from a fast-food restaurant - brisk but polite - and the pricing with noodle boxes starting from little over £5 is extremely good value given the sheer quantity within. A drink can boost the price considerably, though; while you'd be hard pushed even when buying a starter and beer to spend as much as £10, the comparative added expense of drinks does mean that Red-Box can be a less competitive option for a full meal than some other fast-food outlets, based on price alone. Of course, if you're taking away and have your own drinks sorted, then I can't see a single reason you'd go anywhere other than Red-Box to get your food.\n\nNoodle me. Noodle me good, Red-Box, my love.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Note to self - don't buy seats up there unless I bring binoculars! (actually you can hire them at your seat for a pound - which may be a necessity in some seats).  \nBut, this bigness is not a bad thing.

Faces press against the tiny windows looking anxiously for someone in a high vis jacket to arrive with the steps and set us free.   We've had several excuses for these delays:  short staffed, or my favourite (and most frequent offender) - there is another international flight boarding and only one way in and out of the building.  They can't let the people departing 'mingle' with the arriving flight so we have to sit, locked in the plane, until the walkway is completely clear.  I can understand the safety and immigration implications but surely with all the upgrades to the airport someone could have squeezed in an extra hallway!!!  Another star was lost due to the consistently long waits for the baggage.  \n\nIn both instances, travel to and from the airport is pretty simple - great comfy bus - also with free wifi; soon to have trams, lots of taxi's, and easy to access rental car centre (no shuttle bus needed for the major suppliers).  \n\nSo overall is a respectable average of 4*, it's just a shame that visitors to Edinburgh only get to see the best side of the airport as they are leaving.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I recently spent a lot of the night at the airport (due to the aforementioned early flight), and there were a lot of people in the same position as me trying to sleep at the airport.  The thing about Caffe Nero was that they weren't just the only cafe\/shop to stay open, they actually let people stretch out and use their furniture to sleep (without even asking that they buy anything).  All the other places had blocked their chairs and benches off so you couldn't sleep or even sit there, but at Nero you could sleep on these plush leather benches and chairs, or just at tables, and it was just so nice.    \n\nIt really made the time there soooooo much more comfortable, and by enabling me to sleep it actually made me less tired the next day.  I've been in airports overnight before, and it would be hard to exaggerate the difference Caffe Nero made.  In the morning I got a breakfast sandwich before my flight, partially because I was hungry but partially because I wanted to thank them for their (very useful and totally free) service.

Admittedly the two are substantially dissimilar in terms of size and available destinations, however a few differences are note worthy.\n\nUnlike Amsterdam Schiphol, the arrival lounge is pretty much non-existent. A mere Costa coffee sits alongside a whimsically designed arrivals hallway. Shops are scattered around for good measure but with no eye for convenience or ergonomic practicalities in mind.\n\nHaving used the airport now and again for several years there consistently seems to be construction underway within some area of the airport, adding to more inconvenience in some way or another.\n\nAll of these qualities are missing from Schiphol airport.\n\nRant over, it's best to get through Edinburgh airport as fast as possible.

I had a long conversation with their reservation clerk to ensure that a member of our group with severe mobility restrictions could be adequately accommodated. I was also only interested in staying in the main hotel after reading other Tripadvisor reviews.  After exploring all of our options I was able to confirm first floor rooms in the main hotel that would make our stay possible.\n\nImagine my surprise, when shortly afterwards, I received the following email:\n\n\"I spoke with you on the phone earlier regarding a booking at the hotel.  Unfortunately I have promised you rooms which have already been promised to another guest who booked a while ago with severe mobility issues... I am ever so sorry about this.\"\n\nOddly enough, he and I were on the phone together for at least thirty minutes - and even jointly looked at Orbitz online to compare what seemed to be a pricing discrepancy - and both his own and the third party site shown these rooms to be available!\n\nI have since spoken to the manager of the Dunstane House Hotel who gave me a completely different story.  According to her, in an \"amazing, first time ever coincidence\" someone else was booking these exact same rooms, also six months in advance, also with mobility problems and the \"system\" accepted their reservations first.  And, so sorry, those were the only first floor rooms in the main hotel.  Unfortunately, however, the most believable part of her explanation was that, while we were trying to reserve three nights, the other party was booking a two-week stay - need one say more?\n\nThis has been such a unique and unpleasant experience, the explanations so unbelievable, and the discrepancy between the 'instantaneous online conflict' and the 'booked a while ago' explanations so irreconcilable, that I can only offer my personal \"beware\" to anyone looking to make arrangements at the Dunstane house.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

And i have to say while the expansion has been great, so many new routes and new destinations i'm still not overly impressed.  I mean it's an airport and it's hard to be a really awesome airport (unless you are Heathrow Terminal 5!) but there is still something lacking.\n\nI think i need to stress again that Edinburgh is small.  the airport fits the city which is also fairly small in terms to cities throughout the world.  but due to the smallest i feel like it lacks a few essential things, first being a Starbucks!  seriously, this actually breaks my heart since i always fly early in the morning and all i want is a grande tea from starbucks but yet there is none to be found.  the duty free section has been expanded greatly, which is nice, but the restaurants are limited in choice and are overpriced.  i do appreciate that there is a Boots where i can buy cheap water and last minute essentials like tissues and antibacterial hand gel and also an Eat which does pretty good take away at a reasonable price and the Yo Sushi during the infrequent times i'm there when the place is open.  However, there is the other huge negative of the massively overpriced parking fees!  you can't even drop someone off without paying for the privilige of it...    \n\nso overall, Edinburgh Airport is fine, but could be better.  i suppose with more tourists coming to visit the city every year there is still the opportunity for expansion and refurbishment.  so i'll keep my fingers crossed for the Starbucks!!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I would say that taxis have to go through an interesting maze in order to get to the drop off area. If you take the Airport shuttle by Lothian Busses (route 100) from Waverley Station you can get to the airport in about 35 minutes.\n\nIn terms of the people working at this airport, I would say that they are nice, polite, and willing to point you in the right direction. Not too sure how high I would rate the airport due to that, it is a pretty small one so getting lost is pretty difficult in my view. \n\nGetting through security was average to me, a bit disorganised to be honest with only two scanners you have to wait to use (and that has been my experience early in the morning). Other than that, the airport amenities are average. Twice when I arrived back in the evening, everything was already closing. However, this would not be out of line with the rest of Edinburgh so I'm not sure if I would hold that against the airport itself. \n\nIn the end, this is a serviceable airport that is small and easy enough to get in and out of.

Alternatively, quick drop off costs £1 or you can be dropped off in a long stay car park for free, then take a free bus to the airport. Make sure whoever drops you offer leaves straight away, or after 10 minutes they start being charged. Personally, I think the bus is the best way to enter.\n\nUsually customs is quite quick and efficient.\n\nComing from South England, I always used to use Heathrow or Gatwick as my main airports.

I usually go for the vegetable gyoza, though tomorrow morning I will be needing to find some breakfast), one of which is before customs, the other after.

There are a few last minute gift shops, a decent sized duty free, and a few bars (which I never go to so I can't comment on them...)\n\nIn terms of destinations, there are not many direct long-haul flights from Edinburgh, though quite a few with stopovers in other European cities like Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Vienna on route for Asia and South America. There are quite a few new exciting budget flights, including the easyjet to Reykjavik which I will be using in May and apparently a new ryanair flight to Milan Bergamo. Cheap destinations include Dublin and Paris.\n\nFlights are usually on time, though in extreme snowy or windy conditions expect some delays or cancellations; the Brits aren't great at dealing with extreme weather.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Heathrow T5 is like my dream terminal. Gatwick is old-fashioned, lacking any natural light with windows, and is just like a big, barren cave with shops and some places to eat (Jamie Oliver too) but still ends up feeling very depressing - bad lay out too.\n\nSo compared to those two London Terminals, Edinburgh does not bad. \n\nIt costs around £20 in a taxi to get to the airport from the Old Town, and it's around 30 minutes.

They do sell ice cream on the side during intermission. I also don't like that they don't make show booklets and give it for free like other theatres. I think they should, but than again the tickets are a bit cheaper here than in other major cities. I normally loose it anyways... Ha! \n\nSo if you LOVE musicals and you're in Edinburgh, check out this place cause it's where all the great musicals visit the city. If you don't want to pay the extra £4 for processing your tix online and you have time to stop by at the box office, just buy it there! The hours are from 12-6 from Mondays to Saturdays.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It's got that old fashioned, retro and nostalgic feel to it.

I recently saw Avenue Q and Dara O'Briain here - both brilliant shows in and of themselves. The theatre, as it's old, did get quite warm. And there is hardly ANY leg room (this is coming from me and my mighty 5'4 stature.) I think even some seats have less leg room than other. It goes with the old-fashioned territory, back in the day when everyone was shorter (I imagine?)\n\nSo if you can get past the no leg room and rather cosy atmosphere, it's got old world charm, it features brilliant shows, it's got the gaudy fake gold paint and lush, but slightly worn, carpets and I still like it.\n\nI can imagine the lack of leg room will discomfort a lot of people - so again, just be warned when booking. Otherwise, it's a good central location, there's a taxi rank right outside (although obviously expect to queue) and as Seth E has noted, they really do attract the big and best shows.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It holds over 3000 people, is gloriously ornate inside and has seen a number of big names over the years. Acts as diverse as Metallica and Neil Young have filled the premises with their dulcet tones, not to mention the number of smash hit west end musicals it has seen in its time. From the current Chitty Chitty Bang Bang to Cats, JC and more recently, Wicked, people travel from all over Scotland to see plays, bands, musicals and comedy acts in this hall.\n\nYes the paint may be chipping, the seats slightly frayed and the bar is a bit trodden, but these aspects can be found in most theatres. I don't tend to frequent theatre bars since they're always overpriced and a bit shabby, which is a surprising general rule in my experience (even on Broadway believe it or not!) So I would advise you occupy one of the surrounding bars before the show - they are in plentiful supply. \n\nAs for paint peeling, I always feel it adds to the charm of a theatre - although perhaps the Playhouse should maybe give it a freshening up as Emily suggested.

There are a lot of seats to fill, and there are plenty of other venues in Edinburgh playing to the more adventurous, so there's nothing to criticise about the fact that the Playhouse caters to a popular audience. Large-scale touring musicals (usually from London's West End) are the main bill of fare, with big-name musicians and successful TV comedians forming the bulk of the rest.\n\nAs you'd expect, it can deal with pretty much any technical requirement. The stage is enormous, and the lighting demands the Playhouse accommodated for the Joe Bonamassa concert last month were pretty jaw-dropping. I think it might have been the most complex rig I've ever seen.\n\nThe first time I came here (to see \"Oliver!\" - Samantha Barks was playing Nancy) I was amazed at its apparent application of timelord technology. It looks so weeny from the front, but inside... golly. It just goes on and on. I don't just mean the capacity, but the fact is that the seats in the balcony aren't as steeply raked as many other theatres so the rows are more widely spaced; there was sufficient leg-room even for a giantess of my lengthy proportions. Joy! That does mean, however, that the back row is really quite far back, but the sightlines from just about anywhere in the main auditorium are pretty faultless (even in \"restricted view\" seats).\n\nThe only part that seems rather cramped is the foyer; there isn't much room for milling about pre-show. However, the front-of-house staff are all pretty perky; it's a marked contrast with theatres in London, which are peopled for the most part by out-of-work actors and generally have an air of wistful despondence as a result.\n\nOne parting fact: I read recently that this was originally, when built in 1929, a cinema. A CINEMA. Oh, how I wish that cinemas these days had vaulted ceilings, gilded boxes, noble-featured statues and comfortable velvet seats. And Ambassador (Theatre Group), with zis four-month residency of ze Lion King you are spoiling us.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

That there hasn't been a great amount of attention to its decor may just be a sign that it's more focused on its traditional food and perhaps a touch more genuine many other Chinese restaurants.\n\nTo add, once you're in the shop, the staff and very friendly as are all those others like you who have braved the experience.\n\nDon't be put off, try this lovely little restaurant which despite appearances is a cut above the rest.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Despite the size, we had some massively tasty food!\n\nI'm not expert but given the English translation of the menu is a bit of an afterthought, I'd warrant that Yum Yum is as an authentic experience as you'll get in our capital city. Run by a husband and wife I think, he's the cook, she does everything else, the service can be a bit brisque but the extensive menu offers plenty of choice, many of which I've never tried.\n\nIt's important to note the HK in the name, this is not another Chinese restaurant, the dishes are (as was confirmed by a well travelled friend of mine) authentic Hong Kong dishes. \n\nWe didn't have to wait long at all, despite the fact that there were already a few people in and we'd suddenly doubled the number of people eating (there were 6 in our party), and between us we had a good mix of dishes so I managed to try most of them.\n\nI ordered a chilli fried chicken dish (can't recall the name) which was delicious. Tender strips of chicken, dusted in a salt\/chilli\/spice rub and flash fried (I think), which was so moreish I almost forgot about the side dishes we'd ordered. A much different taste to anything I've had before - the side dishes were all delicious as well, perfectly cooked Pak Choi, mushrooms and a generous portion of Yung Chow rice.\n\nIt's a simple place, so don't expect a fancy restaurant, but for me that added to the charm and authenticity, this is very much a place that trades on the quality and authenticity of their food.\n\nIt's not licensed but they are happy for you to BYOB, although the range of soft drinks and teas is pretty extensive so you may not need to bother!\n\nI'll definitely be back next time I'm in that part of Edinburgh.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Unfortunately, I didn't have a very good time. \n\nWe had placed a booking for eight people and had a table set aside for us. I arrived to find that the place was freezing; not the best atmosphere to eat your lunch in. The back door was propped open, so the rear of the restaurant felt like a windy alley. It was baltic! I sat with my jacket on for the whole time. \n\nWe ordered food, but had to wait approximately 45 minutes to an hour - I can't remember the exact wait time, but it was absolutely ages. A couple that arrived after us received two courses and left before we got fed. We were all starving, so even with plenty chat to keep us occupied the wait for food was ridiculous. \n\nThe saving grace was the actual nosh. I ordered the goats cheese and potato salad dish, which came in around £7.50, so not too expensive. Unfortunately, because we'd been waiting for so long it wasn't enough to fill me up. The portion size was not really big enough so I wouldn't order it again despite being nice - I really expected a large salad but all I got in the way of greens was a sprinkling of rocket. Not ideal.\n\nEveryone else seemed to have a lovely meal, however. The falafel burgers and beef burgers were massive and came with amazing looking sweet potato wedges and a side salad. The lamb kofta looked brilliant too.  \n\nSo I clearly ordered the wrong thing. Pick the burger and you'll be good to go. \n\nAfter the main course, we waited a loooooooong time for the plates to be cleared. We wanted to order hot drinks but the table service was very, very slow so again we waited a considerable amount of time. \n\nWe got to order hot chocolates, but when mine arrived it wasn't warm enough, and it was the same situation with another diner on our table. The guy did return our beverages lickety split with much hotter milk, so I was happy with that but it shouldn't have arrived luke warm in the first place. \n\nAll in all, a mixed bag. The place is quirky and cool and is affordable, but the service was very poor, the windy draft was terrible and I didn't really enjoy my meal. For me, there were too many negatives to make this a good experience and I won't be back for food again.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It gets busy early and stays busy late, but the helpful staff will somehow manage to wrangle you a table at the last minute. \n\nIf you're after a bite, the kitchen will deliver in spades. We've tried the pan-seared coley, the mushroom thyme rigatoni and the beef burger, and they were all excellent. The portions aren't heaping big, but the flavors will have the classiest of patrons licking their plates. \n\nWhile the kitchen is more than competent (and turns on a light when a dish is ready instead of clanging a loud bell) the real draw of Under the Stairs are the cocktails. Mary Under the Stairs is spicy and hearty, Chili Palmer is equally spicy but simultaneously refreshing, the Mango Margarita is just sweet enough and You're A Plum is plum perfect, featuring such rare ingredients as plum liqueur and nettle cordial. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, there are few places better for curling up on a rainy day and nibbling on a charcuterie platter or fresh crab cakes while savoring a meticulously-crafted cocktail... or three.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Taking the obvious limited space problem out of the equation (which in itself can either be brilliant as it keeps the place from becoming another city centre meat market) the table service is still a double edged sword of sorts with the most sway coming down on how attentative the staff are. If there are enough people on and they keep a good enough eye on how you're progressing with your drinks and food then it can be a great experience. If however you're having to get up and chase them down every time you want something else to drink then it makes the whole idea of not being able to go to the bar pretty redundant.\n\nI've been a couple of times before and find the staff and most of the clientele to be pleasant enough and it's quite reasonably priced for a \"cool\" city centre bar. The selection of beers is nice and varied and the food I've had was worth the money I paid for it (even if the falafel is a little bland - bloody good sweet potato fries though!)\n\nIt's four stars then as long as it's on the right night and you get the service you deserve.

The one that won me over was the Falafel Burger with Mint Yogurt Dip, topped with Applewood Smoked Cheese and served in a flatbread for £7.85. \n\nIf you're not feeling that peckish, I spied some other people sharing the bread and various dipping oils alongside their bottle of wine, and I have to say it did look tempting.\n\nFor 2 main courses, a cocktail and a pint of Kirin you can expect to get a bit of change from £25; the drinks prices are the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars... everything else about this place is amazing!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

As other reviewers have noted, rather than politely helping customers realise this, you can get rudely asked to sit down before ordering your drink - although sometimes when it's busy you CAN order from the bar but no one tells you this whilst you sit for an age without a drink.\n\nThe memory of the visit I had here in which I asked for sweet potato fries with my fish off the daily specials menu, only to be told VERY rudely I could not and if I wanted sweet potaot fries I'd have to order the burger (our whole table of 6 was left stunned and appalled at the manner the waiter \/ manager had told me this) meant I haven't eaten there since. (Read my previous review below).\n\nBut I have since been for cocktails. I found the window seat to smell of mouldy cabbage (I'm guessing just mould) and the cocktails just don't seem to have any kick to them.

Because of this, they stop letting people in before the place becomes sardine packed, which is really rare, and really nice.  \n\nMy meal here was very reasonably priced (three mains, a bottle of wine, two cocktails a whisky, and a dessert, about 60 pounds) and nice.  I'd read Chris M's review where he commented on the meh-ness of the falafel burger but I love falafel so much I had to try it for myself.  Unfortunately I have to say I agree with him, but again as he said, the sweet potato fries were very yummy, and my friend's halibut was also apparently quite nice.\n\nI'm with the others on the service in that our waiter came by every five minutes looking for our order, but once we'd placed it it was pretty difficult to get anything else.

It doesn't know what it wants to be, a restaurant or a pub. I've been here on quite a few occasions now and even I can't make my mind up on the place. \n\nAs the name suggests Under the Stairs is a basement venue just off the Grassmarket, which makes the place feel cosy. The lower ceiling and eclectic mixture of furniture give the place a very intimate bohemian feel however the mis-matched tables and chairs can be a tad frustrating. Last time I was there I was sat at a table I couldn't get my legs under. When the place is busy not being able to get your legs under a table becomes a major problem as you end up blocking people trying to get by you. The tables are REALLY jammed together and you'll often end up bumping in to people sat behind you if you try to move your chair. \n\nThe whole issue with service is a bit weird too. They insist on table service, which is fine when it isn't busy and staff have time to check on tables, but it becomes a problem when you can't get anyone to take a drinks order because the place is hopping. A little flexibility to allow people to order at the bar would be ideal. \n\nThe food is lovely here and is really its saving grace. The menu has a great selection of main meals and nibbley bar food; plus the specials board keeps things interesting. I've never had the burgers but I hear they are really good, especially as they come with sweet potato fries. \n\nA few flaws to work on, but on the whole, not a bad place to eat and drink.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

After going to nearby Bow Bar tonight, Mason R. and I wanted a little snack... After reading some great reviews on Yelp for Wings Edinburgh, we saw it and decided to explore it. We saw the sign luring us in near Mariachi the Mexican restaurant, leading us down to their side courtyard and into a black door labeled 'wings!' Ever intrigued, we kept going into this 'secret' wing den. We were warmly greeted by one of the co-owners and she kindly explained every sauce on the menu for us, and helped me choose the sweet and unique-sounding Sweet Vanilla sauce for my wings, whilst Mason chose the Hot Oriental sauce. The guys at a nearby table were at the end of completing the spicy wing challenge (and succeeded!) and the place was great and chilled out with playing Nintendo 64 as entertainment.\n\nWhen our wings came, Mason was thrilled with his savoury chicken wings and I loved my sweet, sugary vanilla ones! It was a great value for just £3 for a bowl of six wings, and it felt like a little home away from home. On Sundays they even have all-you-can-eat wings for only £10! The place is only open from Friday to Sunday, and the people here really are passionate about wings and really cool innovative sauces. That's what they do and they are great at it! In the summer, it would be amazing to sit out in their courtyard and relax with wings and the £2.50 Coronas. We will definitely be back... And Mason will conquer that spicy wing challenge while I sit back and enjoy my sweet wings.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

We have one with cheese, a teriyaki one (black magic), a spicy one (chipuffalo?) and something with jalapeños (sorry I can't remember the names). They were all quite different in flavours but I loved them all!\n\nThe chicken wings came to us quick and hot! We were devouring them like beasts! A £4 per bowl?

Whenever I get the chance to get good wings, I will jump on it.  So one day, we decided to come to Wings to give it a try since everyone was recommending it.  The place is a very chilled laid back area and the staff here are extremely hip and nice.  \n\nBeing a chicken wings fan I know how the best wings should taste like.  They should be extremely juicy, greasy with a crunchy skin after they have been deep fried. When you suck on the part with 2 bones, they should just literally come off straight away from the bones and you tear the meat from the joints of the 2 bones.  \n\nHonestly, I am unsure why there was such a big hype about this place.  The wings here tasted like they have been cooked from frozen and not fresh.  The reason is because the wings were dry and tough.  If they were cooked from frozen or not overcooked they should not be dry and tough.  \n\nThe sauce however, there are plenty to choose from and I have no doubt they have the most range of sauce and they are pretty good.  So, I gave them an extra star for the sauce.  However, the wings?  I think it was just mediocre wings under some good sauce.  So .. Wings? Sauce? Wings? Sauce?  What are you here for?  I think I will give it a pass in the future.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Most recently we took 4 friends (including a couple who live directly above it but had never been, madness) who all loved it too, though they could only manage a paltry 2 bowls each - my best so far is 5 bowls (30 wings), nowhere near the restaurant record though.  The service is still good, the staff are all funny and casual, and the 'cook' as their Facebook calls him frequently comes out to chat when the kitchen's quieter.  The £2.50 a bowl deal in April was brilliant too, but sadly it's May now and prices are back to £3.  I think between us we've tried most of the menu too (Gene Parmesan, mmmm, with a bonus Arrested Development reference).\n\nWhy have I given it 4 stars this time though? Well, as another review pointed out sometimes the wings are overdone, and I really wish the flames rating was a bit more honest - or at least that 1 flame really was more like 1 flame, as the jump from none to 1 is too much.  And sadly I tried one sauce I really didn't like. I love blue cheese so finding out that they had added some blue cheese sauce options was very welcome news - until I tried one. Sad Cheese. It was sad. It didn't taste like blue cheese at all and just wasn't nice - though I still ate the whole bowl.\n\nWe do still really like Wings though, and one bad sauce isn't enough to put me off when there are dozens more to choose from.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I would say for a meal, you might want to order two or three portions per person. \n\nI opted for whisky and black pepper and was not disappointed! Plenty of meat, the heat of the whisky and the flavour of the black pepper really complemented eachother. I ordered a beer to go with this and sat back and enjoyed my book. \n\nOver the course of the evening another beer was consumed and one bought for my gal, Jody B.

I chose 2 batches of 6 and can of Pepsi - traditional BBQ style and Disco Wingferno, a hotter chipotle sriracha combination. My sriracha addiction has been well documented in other reviews.\n\nThe wings themselves are great, cooked to perfection. The idea of including a bucket on the table to toss you bones into is genius. All around the room I was in, you could hear the happy \"ding!\" of bone hitting bucket. It was like a surreal chicken horror version of It's A Wonderful Life - \"Every time a bucket rings, a chicken loses it's wings\"\n\nThe sauces were gorgeous - the BBQ was sweet, sticky, warm and just moreish, and the Disco Wingferno was fiery, but not too fiery.

Maybe.\n\nThey also offer chips and tortillas for dipping into the remaining sauce in your bowl, another great idea.\n\nMy meal was a just £8 - for 12 wings and a can of juice.

If you have a glance into the kitchen on the way in or out, you'll usually notice a large mound of pre-fried wings ready to be sauced. Given the amount of seating this place has, there's no excuse to not cook the wings to order.\n\nSecondly, the wings are over-sauced. Too much sauce reduces the crispiness of the wings and cools them down considerably. It's also disheartening to see so much sauce left once you're done.\n\nLastly, it does seem as if though the staff doesn't know how to handle the restaurant when it's busy. My wife and I showed up around 7 PM and were sat at a table for eight people on the condition that we be done within an hour. This wasn't an issue, but there were several people who came in after us who were told that they only had 45 or 30 minutes to eat and leave. Given how quickly the food is served here, this usually isn't a problem. Still, a night going out to eat shouldn't have a time limit.\n\nI spent years living in Edinburgh wishing that there was a place like this. Now that it's finally opened, I just wish it could make some basic changes. If it did, it could be one of the best places in town. For now, though, make a reservation, request your wings cooked fresh, request half the sauce, and make sure you can be there as long as you want. Now you're on to something.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Finally chicken wings in Edinburgh!!\n\nI am a huge fan of chicken wings. Chicken wings and beer - what a perfect combination. I grew up Niagara Falls, Canada just a stones throw away from Buffalo, New York where 'buffalo wings' were created. In North America, it's very typical to go out for beer and wings. Or to go out and enjoy all-you-can-eat wings. This is one thing I have greatly missed since moving here and I am SO glad that this place finally exists in Edinburgh.\n\nWings gives it to you straight up. It's just wings and beer. Oh and chips but you don't want chips - you come here for the wings. They have over 40 different flavours of sauces\/dry rubs. I came on Friday night with my partner and we tried seven of the forty. It's 3 pounds for 6 wings. \n\nMy favourites: Julius the Hot (caesar and Frank's red hot dressing), No big dill (dill and a white cream type dressing), and another one that was essentially a cheesy creamy cheese with FRESH* jalapenos. We also tried the a super hot flavour that's mixed with maple syrup. It was tasty. They have 'suicide' flavour - 11 people out of 65 were able to eat them. If you can handle some heat I urge you to try it out!\n\nThese wings are deep fried, American, buffalo wing style. They are perfect. This is a great place to come with friends before heading out. \n\nLike Kristin C. noted below, this isn't a date spot. It's located in the basement of Mariachi's. There are two people who work here, the cook and the server. The server is Canadian and super friendly!\n\nYou'll wake up the next morning and your fingers will smell like chicken wings (but that's fine). They do all-you-can-eat on Sundays for 10 pounds. Who knows I might be back today!\n\nThis is my new favourite place in Edinburgh. That's all. \n-------\n*I love when restaurants use fresh jalapenos.","useful":7,"funny":3,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Places like Oink doing hog roast, Los Cardos doing burritos and now Wings doing . . . wings!\n\nCheap and cheerful, £3 per bowl of 6 wings. £2.50 a bottle of beer. They no longer do all you can eat on Sundays but the price is reduced to £2.50 per bowl. With about 30 flavours to choose from, you can jump right in and gorge yourself on anything that takes your fancy. \n\nIt's quite nice inside, but still fairly basic. Large wooden tables and metal buckets for your bones and napkins. Very friendly and attentive service means you can order as you go without having to wait around. Really just an excellent concept that provides something you can't get anywhere else in town. Although I do wonder whether the wings craze will spread.\n\nGo there now. Run, don't walk.

Nothing too special and slightly disappointing.  \n\nWings is an interesting restaurant. It has a downstairs basement that has a projector screen and video games, rivalling any teenage boy's room. And that is how it feels downstairs. It isn't overly clean, the seating is a bit awkward, and the noise level can be loud when people are there. \n\nThe selection of wings is insane. They have many combinations to choose from, each different than the last one. I chose the lemon pepper wings. Surprisingly, they were not that great. I wish I could say they were, but the lemon pepper was lacking and the portion was small given the price. \n\nThey do have some beer, which is pretty good. I would say that during my visit I experienced below average service. We were given our food after 30 minutes, with no check back for any reason after that. When the server did come around, I asked for another drink and I was told that he couldn't help me because another group was coming downstairs? \n\nHuh?\n\nSo in the end, I would say that Wings is average. Perhaps it's even a little below average, in terms of service. I didn't particularly like the dark basement vibe -it just didn't feel clean to me.

I'm worse than Hamlet when it comes to procrastination. However, something certainly isn't rotten in the state of Wings.

The concept is simple- wings come in bowls of 6, and you have a MASSIVE selection of sauces to choose from, everything from the wonderfully named \"Nae Nonsense\" BBQ to some extremely hot sauces. I'm not one for spice, but if you are, try the Wall of Flame Suicide Challenge. From speaking to people who have tried it, it sounds pretty intense, but the chance to get yourself up on the wall might make it totally worth it! \n\nApart from wings, the food menu is sparse- some little nibbles like chips etc, but what do you expect? If you come here, you want wings, and lots of them. And the wings are good. They also have a nice selection of beers at reasonable prices, and, best of all, RETRO VIDEO GAMES.

The interior of the restaurant, if that is even the right word, is nothing fancy, which suits the food and atmosphere well. It feels like you are tucked into someone's living room with random nerdy sci-fi posters and mis-matched chairs and tables.

Entirely pointless. They were fairly busy, but our wings came out pretty quickly and all were hot and looked killer! It is a very casual environment and an equally chill dining experience. They also offer the standard beer and small spirit drinks to wash down your feed.\n\nThey have a good range of sauces and styles or rubs or spices for the wings, and with each sauce you get 6 wings for 3.50, served in a paper bowl, slathered in sauce. We opted for the Mardi Gras Madness, the traditional Louisiana Hot Sauce wing, the Mam Prickin Amazing, Sriracha Chipolte Wing, the Tiger Sauce (Buffalo striped smooth) and although not traditional maybe, I got the Dill-licious, maple and dill barbecue wing.\nAll were well fried perfectly and sauced to perfection.

The atmosphere is as \"geeky\" as it gets, matching a lot of our favourite things - like being greeted by C-3PO asking us to wait to be seated.

Near our table there was also a Find Wally wall full of amazing drawings and challenges to find characters (we found them all... in case you were wondering).\n\nAs for the actual food, it's mostly Wings (no surprise there!). I think there were probably around 40 different styles, including dry rubs and sauces, that the wings came in. We had two of the spicy ones and we weren't disappointed. Portions came smothered in the sauce and we didn't run out of our toppings. Portions are straight forward - 6 wings for £4.20. There is a small number of sides available (chips and deep fried tortilla) and they weren't very impressive.

I had been looking forward to going here for ages as i luurrrve chicken wings. However I'm now very glad I hadnt saved it for a special occasion. \nWhen we arrived we were seated in a large room with lots of empty tables but were placed between the 2 occupied tables (who were very noisy) when I asked for a drinks menu I was given the guest drinks menu and when questioned about wether they served g&t the waiter seemed very put out. As he was when we enquired into prices as there are none on the menu, we were told £2.50 for the wings and something mumbled about sides. Chicken wings arrived in paper bowls and we waited to get a plate or something to put the bones in, again waiter much put out when we asked if we could get plates and could we have one to put the bones in, he huffed then pointed to the bucket that was on the table filled with napkins and toothpicks and told us we used that. 2 paper bowls were flung down. Chicken itself was very under par, only 1 out of the 4 we ordered was remotley warm, the tortilla things were nice though. As we had decided to go elsewhere for our main course we asked if we could have the bill, to be told only Tattoo table. Pardon? We asked. Tattoo table at the bar. From which we deduced we were meant to pay at the bar. No receipt was given so no idea how much the drinks were. Terrible experience that could have been totally avoided with one question from the staff- have you been here before? Then maybe a wee explanation of how they work.

The problem is, most of the time you get wings and they're boiled or something and the fat is all blobby and gross and you've got to pick through to get to the meat and it's often a mediocre experience.\n\nAnd then Wings came along.\n\nIt's been on my radar to try for a while but when I got a free bowl status I knew it had to get to the top of the list quickly.  I roped in a fellow wing-lover and we hunted out the random spot off the Mile and discovered the, larger than I expected it would be, home of wings.\n\nThe venue itself isn't much to write home about.  It's a bit chilly, a bit damp, and not as nice as the pictures of their original location suggest.  If they are allowed, I would suggest going for red walls like in the original location. \nBut, the staff are nice and welcoming, the beers are £2.50, and the wings are good.  The wings are actually really *really* good.  They're crispy.  I have never before had wings with such tasty crispy skin that just begs eating.  \n\nWe shared three bowls of wings (something sweet and spicy, the Canadian BBQ, and the garlic parmesan) and some chips, and when it all arrived I said I wished we had ordered more.  By the end, though, we were amazingly stuffed.  \n\nIf we hadn't had a free bowl, 18 wings, chips and 2 beers would have cost us £17.50.  Under a tenner each for dinner and a drink is pretty good these days.  \n\nSo, I now join the leagues of wing-loving fans and am planning my return trip.","useful":11,"funny":5,"cool":8,"type":"review"}

No weird fatty clumps. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple. Just wings, fries and tortilla chips. Lots of wing sauce options, from dry rubs to sweet, fresh and super hot. Was not a huge fan of the dry rub. The spices didnt really stick to the wings on mine and didnt have a whole lot of flavor. Just a bit TOO dry. The wet sauces were nice. The Imperial Tiger sauce is amazing and you will want to bathe in it. After two bowls and a side of fries I was stuffed, though I wanted to try all the sauces. \n\nAtmosphere is relaxed and casual. You dont come here for a nice dinner. It is like your Mom's basement, decorated with Star Wars posters and video game stickers.

It's only been open a few months, but already a flurry of Yelp reviews had me very curious and salivating (drooling) somewhat. A place that does one thing, and one thing only: chicken wings.\n\nAnd with sauces like Oh Canada (Maple BBQ) and Vanilla, I was even more curious.\n\nLuckily, Tanja R suggested a Yelper outting here so 15 of us rocked up one Sunday evening and got one of the big tables. First off, when going here, doing be alarmed \/ confused. It is down a wee alley beside Mariachi, and the door isn't open. It's on your left as you get to the bottom of the wee alley, and just has a sign that says 'Wings'. Nothing else. I almost turned around and went back as thought I'd gone the wrong way.\n\nInside it's just a room, with no windows, that has some basic tables, chairs, and old school Mario Kart. The two guys who run the front of house are decked out in Saved by the Bell Skeeter-type Hawaiin shirts (so bad they're good) and are super friendly.\n\nThe menu is simple. 40 types of Wings flavours, with specials on the walls. The Wings themselves were juicy and full of meat. No wing was too overcooked, so I think perhaps Joe A came on a bad day? I do agree that it can get a little repetitive and there isn't much variety as, well, it's only wings. But you come here knowing that. I'd also say if anyone had a dry wing experience, then come back and try again. 15 of us ordered at least a few bowls each, and every bowl was full of juicy wings\n\nMy Oh Canada! BBQ Maple sauce was a little sweet, but still tasty. The dry Margarita just tasted of lime (I couldn't detect tequila) but still a nice 'plainer' option. The spicy blue cheese was bizarre. But part of the fun is ordering bizarre flavours and just trying them.\n\n£3.50 for a bowl of 6 Wings. One bowl practically filled me up, 2 left me very full indeed. Oh and they do takeaway.\n\nI'd come here again, for a quick pit-stop of Wings or with a big group. Certainly not for a chilled out, lengthy meal. Only reason it's lacking one star as some of the dry Wings flavours I tried were a little too dry, the coating not actually blending on the Wings and just leading to gunged up coating on your teeth.\n\nI also suggested they swap out the chocolate chilli for a Mexican Mole sauce; and try Haggis too. If they do those - YOU SAW IT HERE FIRST!\n\nStill, great idea, they pull it off brilliantly, and given how busy it was, I can tell it's already well loved in Edinburgh.\n\nI'll leave it to Mason R to review the Wings Challenge and how he earned his place on the Wall of Flame ;)","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Their soft shell crab rolls are to die for, ah-may-zing. I'm a maki girl myself and they do a good'un (or six). The price is pretty alright too. Their Special-Seafood Udon runs just under £12 which is reasonable, I've expected up to £16 for that kind of dish in other places. Most dishes are £8-11 while smaller ones are £4-£6. So abig dish and a small dish well fills you and doesn't break the bank!\n\nAtmosphere is friendly, staff are helpful and quite thoughtful. The layout is ok, you can see the sushi guy behind the counter (Oh the excitement!)

The reason why I've been MIA lately is because I haven't been going out anywhere except one specific place, and that place is Wings Edinburgh.  \n\nI was initially reluctant about writing this review because the place is seriously a hidden gem, but after three weekends in a row (told you I literally haven't been going anywhere else) I talked about it with the server and she was extremely happy for me to do so.  And Wings Edinburgh is worth the advertisement.  \n\nFirst, how it all happened.  See, my husband and I had heard about such a place from some mates but had never sought it out.  Then, one rugby day after one-too-many pints we decided to take an adventure and find it.  So we dragged ourselves up the hill on Victoria St. and suddenly found ourselves in front of a tiny sandwich board that just said 'Wings'.  Walk down the dark alley that when slightly intoxicated seems like a trip to Narnia (stone cold sober it feels like the middle of a slasher movie) and you'll find yourself in front of a blue door.  Enter and get ready to eat.  \n\nThe premise is extremely simple.  The menu is wings, only wings, and you can choose between two dozen flavours\/dry rubs\/sauces.  Each bowl comes with 6 wings in the sauce\/rub of your choice, you chow down and put the bones in a bucket on the table.  That's it, pure and simple.  My favourites?  No Big Dill (Caesar dressing and dill) and the Smoked Emperor (a delicious bbq sauce).  The Tiger Wings are fantastic as well.  They've got both sweet and spicy options, and you can mix-and-match whatever flavours you desire.  As for drinks, again simple.  There's about 6 different options for bottled beer, no draft.  The cheapest is Corona for 2.50.  They also do water and milk for the really spicy sauces.  As for prices, a bowl of six wings is 3 each, but on Sundays get ready: 10 for all you can eat!  All the wings your heart desires for 10 pounds.  Big plays.  Feel like a challenge?  They have a Wall of Flame.  Eat 6 wings covered in the suicide sauce and get your picture on the wall.  I had a tiny taste of the sauce and almost died.  65 people have tried the challenge and only 11 people have succeeded.  So good luck with that.  Also, starting next weekend they're starting a count of their most wing eating customers.  \n\nWings Edinburgh is, at the moment, only open Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and you have to check the facebook page to see what time they open (two weekends ago they opened at 4, last Sunday it was 2 [seriously, wasn't joking when I said this is the only place I've been in three weeks]).  And I'm also not joking when I say the place is as simple as it gets.  The wings come in a paper bowl, there's no cutlery, and the only two people that work there are the server and the cook.  If you want a fancy dinner out on the town, this is not your place.  Going on a first date?  You'll have sauce all over your face, maybe not the best (or maybe it is, if so keep that person around they're awesome).  They only serve wings- no burgers, no chips, no salad, just wings.  But if that's what you're after, this is the place.  And it's seriously worth it.\n\nIf you go look for me, I'll probably be there since I can't keep away.  This is seriously one of those hidden gems that makes Edinburgh such a fantastic city.  Next weekend head over to Victoria St. and be on the lookout for a tiny sandwich board, you won't be disappointed.\n\n(the facebook link won't work in the business website place, so here it is- click on it to find opening times and news\/information)\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wings.edinburgh?ref=ts&fref=ts","useful":10,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

I love me some Wings!\n\nSo, we were in Edinburgh for the Fringe, and needed some food. Preferably fast too! I suggested Wings, after visiting their old place last year with the awesome Edinburgh Yelpers. We arrived and I was a little confused about their new space (as it seemed so small!) but it actually goes through to the left and has a space downstairs. As they were really busy, the only table they had was outside but that was perfectly fine. We looked over the menu and I went for Gene Parmesan and the special of Lemon Pot Noodle, with a rum and lemonade. \n\nThe wings were delivered super fast and I was impressed with both my dishes. Lemon pot noodle probably wins for flavour as it did taste just like pot noodle (actually, better as I always find pot noodle a bit bland). Nicely cooked chicken which was soft and tender inside, and a nice bit of crispness on the outside. Gene Parmesan was also delicious, although maybe too much sauce - but as Alex S pointed out, it makes perfect dipping sauce for your chips so that works! \n\nService was super friendly and helpful, I have no idea how these people stay so chipper and happy even on a heaving Saturday (maybe they're high off the smell of wings, I know I was). With wings coming in at £3.50 for a pot of 6, cheap drinks and a good vibe (apart from someone on a stag do vomiting right by our table in the gutter), I have to give wings a happy 5 stars.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Mains are a quid or two more than I would prefer to pay but it is Edinburgh, the dishes contain quite a lot of ingredients, and have a good degree of creativity to them. Also, I loved the presentation, so it's not a huge complaint.\n\nWe'd gone in around 3pm to reserve for dinner, and though it had been pretty quiet at that time when we went back later walk-in customers had a wait for a free table as the restaurant had a few other bookings, too.\n\nAs we're trying to budget a bit at the moment we got a jug of tap water and skipped dessert (the PAIN!). We shared a small nachos that was topped with veggie haggis, caramelised onion, guacamole, hot salsa, vegan cheese, and omitted the jalapenos. It was a decent sized starter for a slightly hefty £5.80 and was delicious; I'd probably get a whole portion to myself next time so I didn't need to share.  \n\nFor the main I got the orange & chilli tofu nacho crumble with quinoa. The tofu is smoked, and it's marinated overnight before prepping with the crumbed topping and was really good. The side of vegetables was presented with a wedge of orange, and the quinoa with a wedge of lime, which I would suggest squeezing over the salad and quinoa to add flavour (which is probably a reason it's there and I just wasn't classy enough to figure this out!). Hubbie got the cashew fritters with rice and satay sauce which impressed him, and I was also liked from the nibble I had.\n\nThey have a specials blackboard which features a dessert, a soup, and a hummus, all of which I presume changes on a daily basis. I will return!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I'm not a veggie so perhaps the novelty of having an entire menu to choose from is lost on me slightly, but I love vegetarian food and healthy, wholesome veggie meals, and both times I've come here i have felt quite disappointed.\n\nI'm saving the one star and making it three as the service is nice, the ambience is nice, and my veggie friend who I dined here with on both occaions really enjoyed it. And ilke I said, perhaps the fact that it's a veggie-dedicated menu and bistro makes it more enjoyable for the plant eaters amongst us.\n\nI also think I ordered the wrong thing, both times. This time I had the special, Spanish Stew. I asked what veg was in it, and was told sweet potatoes, beans, carrot etc. Now, I imagined it to be brimming with several different types of beans. Instead, it had regular potato (a big difference. Sweet potato  makes me happy, regular potato makes me bloaty and unhappy). There was a few beans scattered, and some carrots. That was it. With some rice. It was quite underwhelming. It was definitely overpriced (£8 for some spuds and carrots?) \n\nI mean, for a restaurant that only serves vegetarian food you'd think they'd do it REALLY well. Like go all out, use amazing veg combinations you hadn't thought about or really make the veg shine. I have said since several times that the Innocent Veg Pots and Sainsbury's own sweet potato piri piri pot were both tastier.\n\nMy friend's feta and spinach quiche, however, did look really good. It was LOADED with spinach. Quite often quiche can be mostly egg with some rogue bits of green. This was almost all spinach, and from the bit I tasted, it was really lovely.\n\nThe strudel we shared for dessert was quite nice but again not overwhelming.\n\nI also think they heat up a lot of things in the microwave, as far as I could hear.\n\nI like what Henderson's is trying to do.

Duran Duran bought us all free shots and we danced like Rio on the shore. PSYCH. It was a totally boss night.\n\nSo that's the 411, can you relate?\n\nIf not, you probably shouldn't come here.

At the end of this course, we both looked at each other, there was some telepathy going on, can we lick the plates!?

Yummy.   The boy's cheese plate, oh yes, I had a taste and it had one of the best goats cheeses I've ever tasted.

Easily accommodated and as expected that course was outstanding as well. \n\nMy personal favorite courses were foie gras (perfectly seared, silky and buttery), the aforementioned John Dory and beef, which was easily among the best I'd ever tasted in terms of quality and ideal level done-ness. \n\nIf you enjoy cheese courses, Number One has top-notch cheese offerings, including many Scottish varieties. Try as many as you can! \n\nIt was a lovely, memorable evening thanks to the excellent food and service and I hope to return soon.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

The decor is a bit odd. There is a lot of artwork on the wall (and two that we were sitting next to that were half below our table), and they seemed quite eclectic in style. Some we really enjoyed, others seemed quite bizarre.\n\nThat being said, we were seated at our table and given the menus to look at. We were on a package deal which included the tasting menu, so we had that of course with the wine pairings. \n\nThe first fun thing was the bread trolley that they wheeled up to your table. There were three types of bread: a spelt baguette, cheese bread, and a rosemary bread. The breads were sliced for you at the table, and the bread slicer gave you the option of the end of the loaf (if that's your thing... it certainly is mine so I took him up on the offer). We were also served a few delicious bites at the beginning. \n\nTo be honest, it was hard not to compare some of the courses to some we had at Andrew Fairlie a few days earlier, since both of the meals contained foie gras and scallops. The seared foie gras was amazing (better than the foie gras at Andrew Fairlie). It was decadent and having a bit of truffle with it was just the icing on the cake. The scallops course was also slightly tastier. It wasn't as refined, but the flavors were out of this world.\n\nFor the rest of the courses, I wasn't overly excited about the cheese mouse that came between the foie gras and the scallops. Nothing wrong with it, but a tad boring (for me). The beef was cooked well, and it came with tongue and sweetbreads! I'm definitely an offal sort of guy, so this was very nice. The dessert was good. A bit chocolately and a good way to end things.\n\nWe opted for the additional cheese course, and I'm glad we did. There was a huge selection of cheeses available, and while the cheese man was willing to give us a plate to share, we got our own (mostly because I love goat cheese, and well, the other half hates it). We were both quite happy with the selections we had with the cheese.\n\nThe meal was really tasty. Maybe not quite as refined or interesting as some of the other places I've been, but everything was well cooked and enjoyable.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Number One is a well known Michelin-starred restaurant which is regarded as one of Scotland's best. The team is lead by Executive Chef Jeff Bland, who uses top Scottish ingredients to create edible art which both fascinated me and tasted incredible.\n\n\nWe started with cocktails &'canapés in the bar - fois gras macaron anyone? Bizarre? Yes, but utterly delicious.\n\nWe decided to have the chef's tasting menu with matched wines. They give you a basic menu which literally gives a basic clue as to what you'll be served. When each course arrived we dissected them and analysed them to discuss the ingredients and cooking methods. It's a foodie thing. We need to work out what herb that's in the sauce, or how the salmon was cooked!\n\nWe had a selection of breads to choose from to begin with - I opted for a cheese and caramelised onion loaf. It was divine. I'm not going to give a blow by blow breakdown of each dish - there is so much detail that I could go into, and I think the pictures on my blog speak for themselves. \n\nThis meal, or should I say culinary experience, was just brilliant. The only meal I can compare it to is Restaurant 21212, but as they're both very different, I couldn't possibly pick a favourite. The restaurant is low lit, comfortably quiet and spaced and beautifully decorated. The staff are absolutely fantastic: you're served by a host of staff from waiting staff to a sommelier. Everything is explained, the food is beautifully cooked and presented. The service was slick and yet not too pretentious (yes, there is such a thing).

Firstly, let me say that this restaurant has absolutely no atmosphere.  It's incredibly stuffy and just generally very old-world, whilst simultaneously trying not to be. That being said, I wouldn't have really minded had the meal been enjoyable.\n\nThe meal started with several canapes that didn't seem to go together, much less taste good on their own.

However, each dish that they brought us proved to be one let down after the next.  By the end of the meal, I was so looking forward to dessert - but even the soufflé was horrendous.\n\nWe have eaten at restaurants all over the world, and never have we had a recommendation that proved to be such a massive let down.

Nice decor that is open despite being underground.  \n\nMy lovely date (Jeanne) and I, are on a quest to try all the creme a la creme places of Edinburgh, and Number One was next on the list.  \n\nAnd perhaps I should start off by stating that my rating is terribly harsh, and the only reason really, is because they are not delivering what should be in the price.  We arrived, (reservations are suggested) while we were there, we represented 22% of the people.\n\nBread trolly was surprisingly uncreative, with much of the standard rolls one could find at a good bakery; butter was nice and fresh, and our starters were fine.

Her, rare, me medium rare.\n\nNow come the mistakes, and I really don't mean to get too snobby, but when one pays the prices one pays, you don't make mistakes.

Jeanne, being from France (and from a respectable background), is use to having her silverware placed in a specific way with the fork facing down, not up as is customary in this country.  After the waiter had place her cutlery down, she and I both flipped it in her \"french style\".  When the waiter came to refill our glasses he changed it back.

This is the best meal we've ever eaten in our lives. \n\nLet me take you through this epic culinary journey from start to finish. I booked a place three months in advance for my partners birthday just to secure our place. \n\nUpon arrival, we walked down a flight of stairs to get to Number One. We were greeted by one staff member who took our coats, then another who led us through the dining room than another who say us down. Oh and another serving water and another serving canapes. \n\nI have to admit I was a bit apprehensive before going in because ultra fancy is usually not my style. I was worried whether I was dressed well enough and whether I'd know which cutlery to use and when. Well, I didn't need to worry about that at all! Despite its five star status everyone was welcoming and friendly. Not an air of doucheyness or pretentiousness in sight. \n\nSo we were provided three canapes each upon sitting and offered aperitifs. When my partner asked for the selection of whiskey, well, they just bought the whole tray over! \n\nSo after some general chit chat and a brief look at the menu (as if I didn't check beforehand!) we ordered the 7 courses with tasting wines. \n\nSo our seven course dinner became a four hour event where we ate, laughed, and learnt about an array of amazing wines, each perfectly paired with our meals. \n\nThe amuse bouche to start was a small amount of lobster, perfectly cooked and seasoned with grilled cucumber which blew my mind. \n\nNext came the balmoral smoked salmon with lemon curd, caviar and a quail egg. My partner has named this \"the best dish I have ever eaten.\" Enough said, even of you don't go with a 7 course meal just coming for the salmon will change your life. \n\nNext up the heritage beetroot. Sweet, soft, salty and crunchy this was a curious dish topped with a dijon mustard icecream. \n\nSo by now we were three  glasses of wine in a safe to say, I'm feeling pretty giggly by this point. \n\nThen came the wild halibut atop boiled potatoes. Seriously the best fish I have ever eaten in my whole life. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, really delicate and perfectly paired with the Ataraxia Chardonnay. \n\nThen the main: aged beef fillet with mushroom and a truffle jus. This meal was quite strong in comparison to the others had, but was cooked to perfection and was so tender. \n\nWe were then offered the selection of cheeses which we gladly accepted. We were quite full by this point, but who am I to pass up cheese and fortified wine?\n\nWe then had the pre-dessert, which was a mix of strawberry and watermelon to cleanse the palette. \n\nDessert was a caramel souffle cooked to perfection with pecan and banana. Paired with an amazing port with undertones of toffee which paired well with the dish. \n\nThis was truly an amazing experience I would do again in a heartbeat. The cost of this meal was not cheap, but if you can spare the ££ then this is a must try. \n\nThe dining room was spacious with ample room, far enough from other diners so you can fully immerse yourself in all these culinary delights. \n\nThe staff were do professional and friendly and at times it was like watching a dance- the timing and graceful way they moved around the dining room seemed effortless. Our sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and each wine complimented each dish perfectly. \n\nI cannot reccomend Number One highly enough, it was a truly unforgettable experience.","useful":28,"funny":9,"cool":21,"type":"review"}

As well as undies and corsets, they stock a range of products called 'Yes' which include organic, water based lubricants free from all the colouring, flavouring and general nasties you find in Pina Colada flavour stuff like this from Ann S's. The sex aids are, you guessed it, organic too. They have a large selection of vibrators, and I had to have a little giggle when I noticed the section marked 'Derrière'. I'll leave that for you to translate.\n\nFantastically innovative idea, and even better because it is all aimed and based on us women.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The Illicit Still has always been my back-up Tollcross pub, i.e. I come here when the Brauhaus is jam-packed (which happens more often than not) and Cloisters is overflowing, and the Blue Blazer hasn't got a square foot of space to stand in. Yeah, that's kind of when I turn to the Illicit Still. \n\nI mean, it's not all bad. There's free comedy once a week. The seats are comfy. I can't really remember my experience with the staff, but I'm sure they're decent. They have an OK range of beers and wines. I can't at all recall what kind of music they play, but they sometimes have a silenced film showing on TV with subtitles that don't quite match. \n\nThe goods are: they are possibly the only place in Edinburgh that doesn't charge you an arm, a leg and all your fingers and toes for a pint of Hoegaarden. At the Earl, a Hoegaarden is 4.50. At the Illicit Still it's under 4 pounds. Which is OK. For Hoegaarden. Also, they have an outside bit where you can enjoy a fag or hang in damp Scottish summer air. The best bit for me, though, is that they have board games. Some time ago I discovered the board game Frustration or something like that. \n\nIt's kinda fun to grab a pint over a board game.

I used to be quite insecure about drinking alone, but nowadays I relish the peace, and read a book if the settings allow for that kind of serenity.\n\nThus I liked the Illicit Still. Initially when I stumbled upon this place, I couldn't recognize it, although I had the vague recollection of being here before. As I contemplated why I recognized this region, I remember that not only had I been to neighbouring restaurant My Big Fat Greek Kitchen a few months back, but also my ex's sister used to stay round these parts (basically in \"the pubic triangle\" - lucky her).\n\nSo it was nice reflecting on a bit of nostalgia as I sipped my decent and cheaply priced pint of beer. I had spent a few good nights out in this area when I was a bit younger, and this pub seems like one of the better ones to visit in the area if my memory serves me right. I can't remember how long this palce has been around, but these days it's a fairly modern, laid back kind of place. They have an alright selection of booze on tap, it's nicely decorated inside and they do free comedy once every week.\n\nI can see why the other reviewers can't make up their minds about how much they like The Illicit Still - it's doesn't blind you with unique booze or decor - but places like this are very necessary for a bit of downtime. That's what I acheived, and would recommend it since it's a bit more authentic than the tourist traps towards the high street!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We all really enjoyed the Piccante pizza which had peppers, pepperoni, and chili on it. The chili was a great addition, as in the US we are not used to having that as a topping.

They have another small seating area and large bar in the left.

We saw this pub as we were wandering around and decided to pop in.\n\nSince it's the holiday season, every pub in the shopping area is pretty jammed paced with shoppers and out of town visitors alike, so we thought we'd be ok with this one, being a little bit off the high street.  While it wasn't as busy as the other pubs we'd been too, it was still quite busy but we were able to grab a piece of the bar area to stand at while we enjoyed our drinks.\n\nThis place is a cozy pub with loads of seating and a wrap around bar with loads on tap and bottle of all sorts of booze to buy.  There are books in shelves and cute little granny tea cups for serving nuts and crisps in.  We were just in for some ciders, my guy tried an American cider- Angry Orchard, which I had a taste of and quite enjoyed it.  I typically go for the fruitier ciders, but this one tasted just like apple juice which was nice.  I later ordered it at another pub once we were back in Glasgow.  There were people around us who were buying bottles of bubbly and beers.  The crowd was quite mixed.\n\nI did notice that they serve food, and it looked really great.

Admittedly I class it as my lucky pub as I won £35 on the National with a free bet so the omens going forward were good. Even on a damp, dreich day, the Queens Arms is like crawling into a warm bed and being wrapped in a duvet - comforting, cosy and a little sanctuary abet in the middle of town.\n\nIts a fab little place and full of character - the hanging wine bottles on the ceiling are a great feature and having been in here a few times now, I've yet to see one fall and crack someone on the head. The basement nature if the pub and the wood panelling make it darker but not dank. The little booths are fab if you can get one and its a great way to enjoy a few drinks and a quiet chat without feeling your conversations will be over heard by everyone else in the pub.\n\nI love how there are book shelves - perfect place on a rainy Sunday afternoon to curl up with a borrowed book and a glass of wine and some mini bites - come hungry as even starter portions\/sides are generous.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

There's plenty of seating, with tonnes of nooks and crannys to sit in. When we were in the place was hopping with a (well behaved) hen party, some early-twenties flash-the-cashers, some late-fifties flash-the-cashers, a smattering of tourists, Edinburgers and the odd couple of gents who were in to watch some football. We were lucky to get a seat as we came in the door, another table didn't open up nearby for a good hour after we arrived. \n\nThe bar staff are quick, friendly, conscientious and numerous - the last point being the most important. No one in our party was left waiting more than 10 seconds (ish) to be served.  \n\nThe bar is well stocked. The boys stuck mainly to the ales (Merlin and March of the Penguins were noted as decent) while the girls were on G&Ts and cocktails. The cocktail menu is alright as is the gin selection, though just the one tonic available.\n\nThey lose a star for two reasons. The first was the music which I felt was too loud given the background din of the pub itself, and frankly, was just an odd choice. Chemical Brothers, Pharrell, Avicii and a few others on a loop...I was confused. The second was the lack of whiskey. The whisky selection here is darn good but myself and The OH were looking for a bit of home (Ireland) and surprisingly the bar had no Jameson (Dublin). The OH fell back on Famous Grouse (single malts are not his thing) which is ok, but not the warm Dublin hug I was hoping for.\n\nOverall a nice visit, a great pub and a fantastic atmosphere on a Saturday night!","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Sometimes, though, there's just nothing you can do, and you've gotta cross that imaginary border that exists on Waverley Bridge. \n\nI found the Queens Arms because of the World Cup. You see, I had to be near Stockbridge because a friend of mine who I'd bullied into watching the match with me (and supporting Brazil) had to go to work at 5. So there we were. Pretty hungry and, on my part, excited for the match. \n\nThe Queens Arms has pretty decent, though slightly overpriced pub food. I had a bit of a pathetic 3 onion tart with walnut pesto while my friend bit into a juicy looking burger with chips and chutney. My tart was pathetic not in taste, but in size. I'd expected something somewhat larger for 4 pounds, but hey, sometimes you just gotta be disappointed and deal with it.\n\nWhat wasn't disappointing at all was the decor. For some reason, I'm a fan of people sticking things on ceilings. I went to a bar in Berlin (whose name escapes me) that had furniture on the ceiling and I was delighted. This place has a myriad of empty wine bottles that have been somehow screwed onto the ceiling. I asked few questions, and gawked loads. I also sat out of harm's way. Because. \n\nAnother plus for this place is their selection of ale (priced above 3 pounds).

However, as I'm getting to know this bar well in it's own right, I feel I can discuss it many wonderful points (in addition to it's obvious matchmaking properties!).\n\nThe Wonderful Points of The Queens Arms:\n\nThe staff are so insanely friendly and chatty, I'd quite happily just pop in for a blether! They advise, suggest, smile and have strange super-powers (My friend was asking me what Blue Moon Beer tasted like and, despite the staff being at the other end of the bar, a sample was under her nose before you could say 'Orange Wedge'!)\n\nIt's a very cosy bar with lovely little booths, wee nooks and crannies and a bookcase in the corner! It also has some larger tables for bigger groups.\n\nThere is a unique ceiling covered with (empty!) hanging wine bottles. They look amazing! I only hope the screws attaching them to the ceiling stay strong for a long time to come! \n\nThere is a massive selection of drinks, with a great cocktail menu and lots of interesting beers on tap. The staff will (as noted above!) quite happily give you a sample to try if you're unsure of what to order!\n\nThe food is DELICIOUS!! The fish and chips are fab and, although on the pricey side (compared with standard pub fish and chips!), they are worth every penny. Crispy beer-battered fish, tasty chips and mushy peas Mmmm! The apple and raspberry crumble with home-made vanilla custard was to die for! If you just fancy a wee bite, the starters and side orders are worth a look...and a nibble!\n\nIt's a great place to watch sport, with quite a few plasma screens dotted about the bar. The atmosphere is good and, with the table-service, you need never miss a try\/goal\/match-point because you had to go and get drinks from the bar!\n\nAnd the only Non-Wonderful point about the Queens Arms? It's too far away from my house to be my 'Local'...but well worth the 20 minute walk up the road! \n\nWill maybe meet my future husband the next time I'm in!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Vintage leather chairs and book lined walls. It feels very mature without being like an 'old man' kind of pub (though a pipe smoker next to a fire wouldn't be entirely out of place.) Towards the back there is even an area with loads of wine bottles hanging from the ceiling. Its awesome to see someone who has been sitting underneath then for awhile look up and clock them for the first time. \n\nA word to the wise; be careful when entering the toilets.

A friend had suggested quite a few places for dinner, but none of them seemed overly exciting to him, so we came here.\n\nWe came in on a Thursday night around 6:30 and the place was already quite busy. For me, that's a sign of a good place! We were seated at a table, and quite soon afterwards a large party came in, so we all shifted around to give them more seating (which turned out to be a HUGE mistake). \n\nWe started with a bottle of English white wine and a cheese plate. It consisted of three cheese. We chose it over the meat and cheese plate solely because that one contained manchego and gorganzola. Both nice cheeses, but nothing special. One of the people at the other table really wasn't paying any attention to anything around her except chatting while trying to get up, so she knocked a bottle of water over onto our cheese plate. They did end up getting us another cheese plate (which hey, it might have been cheese overload, but oh well), which consisted of four cheeses instead of three. And two of them were different. It's a bit strange that they opted to give us the manchego and gorganzola on the second plate in place of one of the cheeses, but maybe they were out.\n\nWe then ordered some Italian red wine and the spaghetti with salami in a garlic cream sauce and the ham risotto. It took awhile due to the large table next to us, but we weren't in a hurry so we just enjoyed our wine. The mains were good. We also split the sticky toffee pudding at the end with some port, and that was probably the least good thing of the night. It wasn't sticky enough for me!\n\nThe table of twelve next to us kind of ballooned into around 20 by the end. It was a bit too much for such a small restaurant. I kind of wish they told them they couldn't accommodate such a large party, but I don't even think they thought it was going to get as big as it did! \n\nThe owner (I think he was the owner, who knows?) came up to us at the end, and he started talking with us a bit about wine. He said we had good taste and picked some of the better wine on the menu. That's always a pleasant surprise!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The menu had  2 pages of wine selections which is always good for a wine enthusiast. Overall the service was good.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Sounds interesting, but I went for the deep fried king prawns with Thai beer batter served with a homemade mango sweet sauce. They were lovely - three large morsels with a tasty dipping sauce which wasn't too sweet. \n\nFor main course I had a duck stir fry.

Booking online was super easy, so already a bonus.  Finding the hostel was easy as well, and close to a Starbucks so when you have to be there at 7:45 a.m., you can get your caffeine fix.\n\nI printed my receipt\/confirmation, but it wasn't even looked at (but I would still take it just in case).  The tour guide\/driver was there at 7:45 a.m., but there was no intro or anything like that until 8 a.m. when we were on the coach ready to go...  so it was a bit pointless to be there that early (yes, when it comes to me and my sleep... every minute counts).  Anyway, Michael was our guide, he talked a bit, and then played Scottish music or music by Scottish artists.  Glad there was a mix of music because while I appreciate bagpipes, there's only so much I can take.  Did appreciate the Scottish folk songs, which played when relevant, really added to the experience.\n\nThere were 11 of us and just about everyone else slept through the tour, which I think annoyed the guide because he didn't feel like anyone was listening to him, but I was.  Lots of history, lots of stories which was nice, but would've liked some more stories...  more of the thing that maybe only locals would know because those are the things you can't look up.  I know it means that it would take a little longer, but a couple more stops, just on and off the bus to take pictures would be nice as it is difficult to snap pictures when you're speeding along the twisting and narrow roads.  Wasn't necessarily a fan of some of the stops...  and if you're not a fan of the large tourist stops, you probably won't like them either.\n\nWe got to Loch Ness at about 12:30 p.m., giving me enough time to run to the supermarket, grab a sandwich and crisps, then get on one of the boat trips.  The boat trip is about an hour long and 11 quid with your Macbackpackers discount.  I liked the relaxing trip, but I don't know if it was really worth it.  I would've liked more time in Fort Augustus to wander about.  Some of the people in our group were late (20 minutes...so I guess I could've had a wee wander), but as a result we did get to see the swing bridge in action and boats going through the canal.  We did get to go for a wee walk at a viewpoint in Glencoe, another tea and pee break, and a stop to see Hamish the hairy coo.  We did arrive back in Edinburgh an hour earlier than anticipated...  so I guess it actually is possible to add a couple more photo stops in there.\n\nOverall it was a nice trip, wished our guide had been a bit more lively, but then again our group wasn't very lively either.

Hmmlet's start by saying that if there was such a thing as a backpacker cult, their temples would be MacBackpackers hostels. This company has been dominating the Scottish hostel and tour market for 7 years, and I pray that they keep on truckin', never changin'. I have stayed at each of the 8 hostels (multiple stays at some locations) and taken 3 of their tours. I therefore proclaim myself an expert, and you, O Reader, would do well to take my opinion as gospel\n\n\n First of all, the quality of their tours and accommodations is tough to beatexpect blazing, real log fires in the lounge, with hot chocolate, tea, and coffee always on hand. Beds, bathrooms, and rooms are impeccably clean. Staff are professional, yet funky and always, always friendly. Tour guides are knowledgeable and very entertaining. The entire operation seems to be run tightly and smoothly, but with an overall sense of fun.\n\n\n I HIGHLY recommend the Skye tour, and I really like the Oban and High Street hostels. So much character! SO cheap!! MacBackpackers tours often cost the same, or even less, than purchasing plain ol' public bus fare to the same location. Unlike other tour companies I've traveled with, there is little sense of a strict schedule that must be adhered to: twice my MacBackpackers guides altered plans or made unscheduled stops to accommodate the interests of the passengers. As tour guide Lynn put it Heyit's your vacation! I like her thinking. Lynn, who surprised us as she passed around a full bottle of whisky and shouted Welcome to the Highlands! as we cruised past the border, pretty much embodies the MacBackpackers frame of mind.\n\n\n Let them welcome you.

Chancellors Court was generally reserved for the yah's at Edinburgh Uni - I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but the rooms are lovely, modern and clean. All en-suite, naturally. Chancellors Court and Holland are the only two houses with en-suite facilities. I stayed in Holland B block (following my brothers recommendation) and loved it. Yeah, the rooms weren't huge and the toilets were tiny, and the walls were really thin, and it got cold (wow, I'm really selling it) but it was fantastic. Because Holland was one of the older houses it had a real sense of tradition about it. I've made some brilliant memories in Holland Block!\n\nThe JMC food-court left a lot to be desired, I'm afraid to say. Their breakfasts were good, always a great selection of fruit, cereals and cooked breakfast,but their dinners went steadily downhill as the term progressed. Don't get me wrong, it was all edible (but i once got a bad bug from the beef goulash) and if there was nothing you fancied there was always salad and cold meats, but it wasn't amazing.\n\nOverall, however, I thoroughly recommend Pollock Halls.

When I heard Giuliano's did gluten-free pizza, I thought it would be a great opportunity to try it as I had a friend visiting from Canada with gluten allergies.  So, four of us went, were greeted by friendly staff and were promptly shown to our table.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a pleasantly tacky decor, trying to emulate what I would imagine to be Italian sculptures, photos of Italian scenery and copious vine leaves. Despite the cheese, I did enjoy it for what it was.\n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu with a variety of salads, antipasto, pasta, pizza and traditional Italian dishes.  My friend and I decided on the red house wine and our partners got glasses of Peroni.  This was when our waiter eventually decided to come over.\n\nThe service, from our experience, is what really let this place down. While there were a number of servers there that seemed keen and attentive, our waiter was the better part of uninterested in us.  While we were pouring over the menu, another couple sat down beside us. After waiting for about 5-10 minutes without having even been greeted at their table, they left.  The front of house could not understand why they left and I felt like telling him it was because the waiter they had on our particular section was rubbish.  He finally came to our table to take our drink orders, and when we eventually got to put in our food order, it was very promptly brought to the table. However, he did not once check if we needed anything else, or if we even wanted water and we found it difficult to get his attention.  Now I am not the type of person that expects a waiter to be at your table every 5 seconds asking if things are OK because that is also undesirable.  However, when they take ages just to even acknowledge you are there or offer a drink, then don't even check later on to see how your meal is doing I think it's unacceptable.  \n\nOn to the food! Our guests raved about the Caesar salad, and it did look quite nice so I did wish that I tried it.  For my main I had a mushroom ravioli.  While you got a big portion and it was nice enough, it was slightly mushy and not hot, just kind of luke warm.  But it was fine and I ate it all.  My friend's gluten-free pizza looked nice, as did the lasagne and canalonni type dish my partner had.  The food overall was fine, not excellent but certainly satisfactory even though I've had much better.\n\nGiuliano's is fine if you are looking for a quick Italian meal with a bit of Italian cheese-factor thrown in in terms of the decor, the happy birthday shenanegins (they dim the lights and play music, then sing) and the overall atmosphere.  The prices aren't too bad and the house red is nice.  In terms of Italian restaurants overall in Edinburgh though, this is not one I would hurry back to. I found the food to be slightly sub-par although edible and the fact that our waiter could just not be bothered are deterrents.  But I would recommend people try it for themselves if they are remotely interested in going. I would probably suggest Vittoria's or La Favourita as excellent alternatives though.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The Dunfermline branch on Campbell St was recommended to me by the estate agent who is selling my flat as they do great off-cuts, good value but decent carpets, and can fit quickly. Because of the large roll sizes even large rooms could be carpeted with a so-called offcut. In my case, they fitted the afternoon of the same day I picked a carpet.

Easy to spot, great quality, the white and pink one was the one for me.\n\nI noticed the girl at the counter was reading The Time Traveller's Wife.

The pizza is amazing!\n\nThe Three Coins is a hidden gem of Edinburgh. While staying at the Edinburgh City Hotel I decided to try this place after reading other yelp reviews and I was not disappointed! The store front may not look like the most glamorous from the outside, but don't judge this book by it's cover. \nAs soon as I walked in I was greeted by the owner Pedro and he made exactly what I asked for from scratch! Nothing is pre made here - he even cuts the peppers to order it's so fresh! \n\nMy only complaints was the pizza was a little thin, so during my next visit I asked if we could have a thicker base which ended up perfect!!!!! Second time around was honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever ate. \nI ordered half and half each time, chicken and peppers on one half, ham and pepperoni on the other + extra cheese. For a  12\" pizza it cost £8 and £8.50 for a thicker base. 10\" is also an option, I think it costs £5 or £6. Each time I shared half with my girlfriend and we both wished we had more. \nA whole pizza for one would be the perfect order. \n\nSicily native Pedro is one of the most lovely store owners I've ever met. I loved talking to him, the second time I brought my girlfriend along just to meet him. His store has been around for 28 years I believe, beating away local competition that only care about the money (look across the street). Pedro is all about keeping his customers happy and it's no wonder he has 5 star reviews. He even shook my hand as I was leaving during my first visit, and when I returned for more pizza he remembered me and expressed how happy he was I returned. \n\nThe Three Coins is now a must visit every time I visit Edinburgh! I can't wait for the next time I visit my new friend Pedro to order some delicious pizza.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Now if you don't know, not all chip shops are created equally; they all lure you in with the heavenly aroma only triple fried meat and potato can make, but few live up to the hype.

Their starters include traditional Italian dishes including bruschetta and melon and ham, but there are more exotic entry's too such as snails La Rusticana pizza's are some of my favourite's in the city as the base is super thin and doughy with no burnt bits! They always add lots of toppings and don't skimp on the cheese which is always a bonus. They also have a vast selection of pasta dishes and their spaghetti with clams and tomato's is particularly gorgeous. La Rusticana also serve a selection of meat dishes including steak, chicken and veal. \n\nThe prices are incredibly reasonable here, with pasta and pizza dishes costing about £6 - what a bargain. There are a vast range of wines available and the house red which I had was really tasty and inexpensive but it didn't taste cheap. A great place to go for a tasty Italian meal.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

These fairly substantial looking sourdough sandwiches aren't just your usual cheese and ham affair.

They are clearly passionate in here and I keep coming back. \n\nThe venue itself is unusual. It's definitely rustic; woods beams and eclectic decor. It's quite dark. It feels like the kind of hip cosy highland place you would want to step into after a trip up the Cairngorms, although maybe not after a sunny afternoon shopping trip on George Street. It's good to have some variety and I appreciate a coffee shop that doesn't just look the same as everywhere else.\n\nOne good thing about Cairngorm is it's open till 7pm.

The coffee is good and the venue is nice - it is small and while it doesn't exactly invite you to stay a while, it is perfectly adequate for while you're enjoying their wares.\n\nIt was the service we experienced which really let the side down.\n\nSo, I'm growing a person and I like coffee.  Little person likes coffee too and my penchant for lattes has increased so I now have 1-2 a week (vs 1-2 a month previously). But, in order for a latte to actually taste of coffee and not just vaguely coffee-ish milk, it needs two shots of espresso. Fortunately, most places (including Cairngorm) do two shots. UNfortunately, that may be tipping the caffeine while pregnant scale a bit on the high side. So, I discovered the half-decaf latte. One shot caffeinated espresso, one shot decaf. Flavour with half the caffeine. \n\nI have never had a problem ordering this anywhere, until I came to Cairngorm.\n\nI ordered and the barista said \"so just one shot of espresso?\" I explained that, no, I wanted one shot of normal espresso and one decaf, if that was ok. She repeated what I said in a way that screamed \"are you having an absolute laugh?\"\nI said yes, that was right, and was that ok?  I was treated with a *sigh* \"YES\" *extended pause* \"that's fine\"\n\nIs half decaf more work?  Yes.  Were there any other customers either in line or in the cafe?  Well actually no there weren't. In fact, they were more than an hour to closing and not one person came in after us. \n\nI 100% understand how it's annoying to have to make weird specialty drinks for someone, but when you literally have nothing else to do it should really not be an issue. And frankly, when I'm visiting a cafe, I expect to be able to get what I want to drink as opposed to settle for something which is more convenient for the barista to make.\n\nSo all in all, not loving it.

So whether you're popping in for a quiet pint after a stroll along the shore, or you're settling in for a session on a Friday night, this is the perfect mix of local bar and welcoming pit stop. And did I mention they have hops on the walls? (ok they're fake. I think. But still! They're intertwined with fairy lights!) If you like traditional boozers, this is one of the best.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

So I decided to try it out with another friend who has the taste card (two for one). He called them quite a few times on the phone but there was no reply. It was a surprise looking at their website: not updated since 2009? Really??? \n\nOn the plus side their glorious menu is available at Just-eat, so you can certainly be interested from there (no, there is no direct link for their website to Just-eat). I saw a gentleman going out with bags for delivery, and I think some people came in for take-away. \n\nThere we go, Friday evening after work, it's raining cats and dogs and we arrive at the restaurant. You can have a look at one of the Yelp pics: the titles on the windows look so old to me. \n\nThe waiter is friendly, letting us choose a table far from the door and he brings us the menus immediately. As we review the very-detailed menu, I notice an ant walking on the salt jar!!! I start making mental notes about my Yelp review... \n\nMy friend was more relaxed and removed the ant, and told me not to be harsh. Well, an hour later, we saw another ant walking on the wall behind my friend!! \n\nWe ordered the food: Ceylon lamb and vegetarian Malayan, both having coconut, with the second one being sweet as it includes pineapple. We were both so pleased and delighted with the food, forcing ourselves to eat it slowly to enjoy more along with a tasty garlic naan bread. Our Mixed Pakora was also of great quality with a special sweet and hot sauce that made the difference!! My friend who has tried lots of Indian restaurants in Edinburgh found it astounding! \n\nHowever it was another gentleman now serving us, who has been in that restaurant for less than a year, as he told us. \n\nAnd we started noticing his difficulties waiting for the other tables: there were big delays for some of them from the time they ordered till they got the starters. A couple must have been waiting for at least 15-20 mins (the guy hadn't manage to take their order yet), and they decided to go... \n\nMy advice: if you're a big curry fan, you need to try it!!

The door is normally wide open, the seating plastic and lacking in any comfort, and the walls stretch up for ages before hitting the ceiling - it definitely does not feel cozy. \n\nHowever, for all of the chilly feel, the frozen yoghurt is universally enjoyable. It's a bit on the pricey side, but if you get a large portion to share it's a bit less of a sting on the pocket. \n\nI love how there are loads of fruits and healthy things to top on your yoghurt.

The decor of the shop had always been inviting! Unfortunately this is where excitement ends for our visit.\n\nHaving spent ages deliberating what we both were going to pick, (I will mention at this point, we have both had froyo many times before) we decided upon their cherry flavoured frozen yoghurt. Bad choice! As It was well and truly off!! Not just zingy, or about to turn. Full on, putrid - I had to spit mine back in the bowl, yuk ) : \n\nOf course we took it back to the counter to explain. The girl that served us said she would get the manager to see us. Who then proceeded to taste test our yoghurt and simply replied 'it's the flavouring making it taste like that'?! We were then ignored as she carried on serving someone else! We were astonished to say the least, as we left extremely disappointed. No alternative offered, no refund given and an all round, pretty below par poor service, not to mention passed it sell by date product! You can say we definitely left with a bad taste in our mouth...Therefore this warrants only one star, which I give to the shops interior.

I was blissed out and warmed to the bone from the heat treatments.  I was a bit hungry but didn't want a full meal.  Just across the road I spotted Frisky.  Hmm... Frozen yogurt.  That just might do the trick!  I popped in.  It was deserted except for the one staff member.  He seemed happy to have a customer so I had to try something!  I ordered a medium plain yogurt and checked out the toppings.  Lots of cookie\/chocolatey\/gooey things but also lots of healthy fruity options, which I think go much better with the yogurt.  I went the 'SuperFood' route and topped my yogurt with fresh blueberries and pomegranate seeds (so much nicer when someone else has freed them from the pomegranate!).  \n\nAs he handed me my tub I did a double take.  'Is this a medium?' I asked, looking at the behemoth mountain of yogurt and fruit.  He just smiled and took my £4.60.  I glanced at the stacks of paper cups and I am positive he gave me the largest on offer.  Maybe he was influenced by the zen-like energy I was giving off after the spa or maybe he was just trying to get rid of product from a not so busy day.  Either way I managed to devour my frozen mountain.  The yogurt itself was average.  Refreshing.  Not too sweet. Being picky, I would have preferred it a bit more tart - or 'yogurty'.  The fruit was the star - lots of fresh plump blueberries and dark, sweet pomegranate seeds.  I can't guarantee that this is a typical example but I'll definitely go back to find out.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Everything is freshly prepared and the food ranges from traditional pub grub with a bit of a twist (merlot and rump pie or Grolsch battered sea bass) to classic Mexican dishes like burritos and nachos.

There were people of all ages here, from family meals to girly get togethers and mates nights out.  The decor was really cool, walls of colourful artwork on a day of the dead theme, as well as lights made from recycled Tequila bottles, and a whole wall of drinks (on the way to the toilet and by a small dining area there is a wall which is lined with bottles of the spirits which they sell, I guess it is probably meant to be functional but it looks very aesthetically pleasing and would encourage me to explore new drinks.\n\nTheir drinks list was amazing, I do not know anything about tequila and mezcal so it was cool to see the range of things which they had, and have the tasting notes.  I quite fancied the tequila taster option (flights of tequila... never seen that before, only beer or occasionally wine) but we were not out for 'big drinks', more for a nosy of a different part of Edinburgh so didn't think shots of tequila would be that wise.   We did have an interesting little soft drink shot, I wanted to get a little taste of chilli, and it did not disappoint! Apparently in Mexico people drink some palate cleaning juice between courses or even between tequilas- they have five flavours of 'amigos' to try- which come in a shot glass.  There was sadly no mango flavour left (fresh coriander, mint, jalepenos, mango juice and lime juice) but we tried the tomato one which was tomato juice, orange juice, lime juice, grenadine, cayenne and chipotle. Mmmmmm. Only £1 too!\n \nFrom the ten draught beers on offer we had dark keg London Stout, which was served in branded moustached glasses.  They have 20 bottled and canned beers listed on their menu, as well as wines and soft drinks; they didn't have Jarritos (my favourite Mexican soft drink) but I can forgive them for that as it was such a lovely visit.

When you go to a Chinese restaurant outside your own country, you are bound to get a style of cooking very different from what you are used to.  I am accustomed to that phenomenon.  I know enough about Chinese food to ask from what part of the country the cook comes.  For example, you do not want to order spicy from a Southern Chinese chef.  I also look for unusual dishes on Chinese menus.  All that said, I need to be VERY careful in Chinese restaurants because I am sensitive to GLUTEN and both my wife and I react badly to MSG; almost ubiquitous in Chinese cooking (gives food a salty\/meaty flavor).  99.5% of soy sauce brands are made with WHEAT.  Even at home in the Washington, DC suburbs, few restaurants have gluten free (Tamari) soy sauce.\n\nI saw \"cod Cantonese\" on the menu and after assuring that no soy sauce or MSG would be used, I ordered it.  I EXPECTED something like the probably very AMERICAN\/Chinese \"shrimp in lobster sauce.\"  Instead, I got a most delightful fish dish that incorporated some chili peppers.  I would NEVER expect that in a Cantonese dish.  The price was very reasonable for this and other entrees.\n\nMy wife and I also ordered two grossly overpriced, but excellent soups.  Appetizers, soups and beverages are great sources of profit for restaurants.  They gotta make money somehow!\n\nService was wonderful.  The atmosphere was very suitable for a Chinese restaurant.\n\nWalking distance from the Sheraton.  Next door to the USHER and another theater.

My husband's family have been semi-regular patrons of Jasmine for years and as soon as they took me, I could see why. \n\nA small family owned and run restaurant (maybe twenty tables max), the decor harks back to the 1980s and the Chinese restaurants of my childhood, which instantly makes it feel homely. They don't really try and re-invent the wheel here and so what you get is all the \"usual\" dishes prepared to a very high standard. \n\nWe visited on Saturday before a gig at the usher hall. I'm glad I called ahead to check table availability as we managed to snare the very last table for two for the rest of the evening (at 18.15) and there was a steady turnover of tables large and small whilst we were eating.\n\nWe decided to go for the set banquet for two for a change, which came in at the amazingly reasonable price of £20.80 per head. For this we got: chicken & sweet corn soup, prawn crackers, mixed starters (or duck pancakes), two mains from a tasty set list of six dishes and two bowls of rice.\n\nI would describe the set banquets here as classic \"British style\" Chinese food. The soup was gloopy & delicious. The mixed starters comprised spare ribs, won tons, spring rolls and a sort of California roll thing (?!) plus dipping sauces - yummers! We chose honey chilli chicken and sweet and sour pork for our mains and were impressed that neither were deep fried and both contained freshly chopped and cooked veg. Tasty and not at all stodgy - which can be an issue at other Chinese places.\n\nThe service was leisurely. This surprised me given how busy they were but was much appreciated given the volume of food we had ordered!\n\nAnother fun thing about Jasmine is that you can peek into the kitchen on the way to the loo - amazing to see all the chefs & wok action in motion.\n\nWhilst Jasmine is wheelchair accessible, the loos are not, being located downstairs. I reckon the public cafe bar in the usher hall could be used a pit stop if these facilities are required. \n\nNot much else to say here other than I love a bit of Jasmine!!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

So I would imagine that it would be quite nice to own something which used to belong to a certain famous person! \n\nThe shop inside is sharp, has a retro feel and also is set up like a classy boutique! The staff are also very friendly. A brilliant, quirky approach to a charity shop, that only adds to the already brilliant amount of great charity shops in Stockbridge! This is defiantly the place to come for those birthday and Christmas presents!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

So you can get a snazzy outfit for a dinner party at an absolute steal of a price!\n\nWith its creaky, varnished floorboards and warm lighting, it feels as though you're in Monsoon rather than in a charity establishment.

I'd been told it was pricey with an overbearing organic 'we love the earth' ethos that just put me right off.  but after a brunch location nearby was too crowded we decided to head here for some brunch instead.  what was a very tasty sharing board in my memory when i saw an itison voucher for a main course and glass of wine for 2 for only £14 i quickly bought it.\n\nthe voucher itself was incredibly good value as a main course comes in around £10 and a 175ml glass of wine around £4-5 depending on what you get.  so basically a two for one deal.  Earthy has an all day menu, so after breakfast time you get the same options for lunch or dinner.  i went with the lamb meatballs and the boyfriend went for the burger.  i added on a side of green bean and barley salad as my main was literally just a bowl of meatballs.  all the food arrived in decent time and i have to say it was incredibly tasty.  although for my main i really feel like it could have come with an actual side and that is probably my biggest gripe with Earthy's menu.  the majority of main courses only come as the single item, nothing on the side.  which for the price you're paying £10 or more you could at least get a bit of green salad on the side really.\n\nafter our mains, we were tempted into dessert after spying what the table next to us had gotten.  we shared one of the best bread puddings i've ever had in my life and i only wish i could remember what was in it.  either way it was amazing and if i saw it on their menu again i would go in just to have that!!  with the added sides and dessert our bill came to around £10 i think, so overall £24 for two people for two mains, two glasses of wine, a side, and a shared dessert is pretty good value.  i'd definitely buy the itison voucher if i saw it again but will probably stick to their cheaper breakfast and brunch offerings when i head back there again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Decided to head along on a dreich and dreary night as the menu looked to be fairly veggie friendly (for the girlfriend) and enough meat dishes for the non-veggie.\n\nWe arrived to be greeted by a barrage of noise and the waiter explained that there was a girls 16th birthday taking place which was why rubbish music was playing in the background. I have tried not to let the background annoyance influence the review as that is something that the venue can't help (but jeez,16-year-old girls are so bloomin' screechy!)\n\nFirstly, don't base your decision on going to Earthy on the menu online. It's fairly different to the actual menu and there are some more choices in real life. That said, it was (rather unusually as a meat eater but good for a veggie) lacking in a wide selection of meat dishes. The Venison Ragu with Kale that I had was pretty good and an unusual mix that I hadn't had before. My partner had the mix of four salads which was enormous and great value! So food was good, not amazing but not uneatable.\n\nDrinks are very expensive, £5 for a bottle of Williams Bros beers is a bit over the top given that they can walk around the corner to Tesco and get one for £1.65\n\nGiven the competition that is around Canonmills Earthy wouldn't be the first place I'd be jumping toward for a night out but if I was heading out with more than 1 veggie it probably would be somewhere I would suggest.","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

I love to come in here and admire all the beautiful bags which I can't afford - handbags cost in the range of £300, and clutch bags cost about £100. There is a lovely smell of leather when you walk in the store, which makes me want to buy the bags even more. Covet also sell a gorgeous range of wallets, belts and jewellery which are just as grand and beautiful as their bag collection. Their jewellery selection includes pearl earrings and jewel necklaces which are all absolutely beautiful, and best of well, reasonable prices at about £40 - amazing! \n\nCovet is a great place to buy a gift for someone or to treat yourself to a lovely handbag. I can't wait until I am able to afford their beautiful bags.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It's a tiny restaurant with a modern menu. A lot of the dishes were takes on traditional Scottish ingredients.\n\nAs our starters, we shared the lemon and leek ravioli and venison tartare. I wouldn't recommend the ravioli just because it's a single piece. Really should be called a raviolo. The venison tartare was wonderful though.\n\nFor my main, I had the pan-roasted partridge served over potatoes and mushrooms. It was cooked perfectly, and was paired well with the jus.\n\nI also tried the lamb neck, served with a parsnip puree and leeks. It was very well balanced, and all the flavors complemented the lamb very well. Definitely a highlight.\n\nThe portion sizes are a bit small, so load up on appetizers.\n\nAnd keep in mind that this place is fancy by Edinburgh standards, but it's still not wildly unaffordable, so order that extra bottle of wine!","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I went there with a big group last night and we were all blown away by the quality of the food, the wine and the service!\n\nThe menu is short and simple, which is a good sign as you immediately know everything on there's going to be well done. There's no filler dishes - they're all there for a reason - and from what I tasted and saw around the table, the standard of dish was consistently high!\n\nI opted for the chicken starter and the pork belly main and loved them both. The chicken starter was brought out on a beautiful wooden platter and arranged wonderfully, with bursts of colour and delicate placement. The flavours were great in this dish and it had enough different aspects - the chicken, the samosa, the feta stuffed peppers - to make it an exciting start to the meal. \n\nWhen my main arrived I was equally as impressed. The baked avocado was insane. I mean it was, quite literally, mind-boggingly delicious. Baked to perfection and topped with cheese, chorizo and sweetcorn it was just one of the tastiest combos I have ever had. It sat alongside the pork belly really well and is something I will absolutely be making (attempting) at home. The pork itself was beautifully cooked but lacked a slight crispiness that I would have enjoyed. The fat was a little thick and soft for my taste, but otherwise the meat was flavoured wonderfully.\n\nTo top it all off, we shared desserts for the table and, though I can't recall what each of them was, they were all super tasty and very beautiful! \n\nField is just hitting the nail on the head here. With some of the most attentive staff I've ever come across and the perfect vibe of a cosy by still atmospheric venue, Field ticks all the boxes for me. If only it were in Brighton... I'll have to make sure I get back up to Edinburgh again soon to taste some more of it's delights.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Talk about a neighbourhood restaurant with it being so relaxed that there's a real feeling of sitting in someone's living room, but one that serves top notch grub at the same time. \n\nBig shout out to Jenny L who kept upping the ante all week with quality meals coming at every single corner and for our final night came up with this quality experience! \n\nI'd have to say that I'm going to recommend this place to anyone who will listen to me about where to go for a really special dining experience without breaking the bank. I went for the Beetroot cured salmon to start with which was served with a wonderful avocado mayo and crispy crab ball followed by the pork belly which basically just fell apart it was that tender! Loads of people went for the specials board steak which was amazing too (I always try to make 'please share with me eyes' across the table) but I felt comfortable in my decision to go for the pork - so, so good! \n\nSo ambience was easily a 5, the food was a 5 too so why the 4 star Yelp review? Again it was the beer selection that let the place down - 2 bottles on offer -  one was a local lager that was ok and Peroni - WTF? In fact the waiter sold me the local lager as basically a \"don't worry it's not too hoppy\" which is like saying to me don't worry about the food it's not that tasty. If they can ditch the Peroni and bring in a couple of proper beers that would massively compliment the food then I may even start lobbying Yelp to introduce a 6 star for reviews...","useful":6,"funny":4,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

I am SO glad she did!\n\nWe called the evening before and they were able to squeeze us in for a 5:30 pm reservation on a Friday night (in November). We were the first to arrive but were not made to feel like we were imposing on the staff. Very small restaurant, was giddy excited they could fit us in on such short notice. \nService was friendly and very comfortable. No issue ordering tap water and it was refilled!  Oh and this was no regular tap water, it was cucumber and mint infused!\n\nIf you dine early, there is a pre-fix menu. I chose the three course for £14.95 (two for £11.95). My starter was the mussel saffron tagliatelle. Aside from the color, saffron didn't come through much and it was interesting to see the mussels out of the shell but this was a nice size for a starter and nice flavors.\nI couldn't resist the pork chop over pearl barley risotto BUT was worried the pork would be over-cooked and risotto bland. NOT AT ALL. The pork was perfectly cooked (pre-sliced for me) and the fat cripsy and salty. The pearl barley risotto was nice and milky. The sliced apple pieces provided a good cut to lighten the taste and add to the texture. This was a stand out dish. I finished it with the chocolate brownie and peanut butter ice cream (which i shared with my dining companion). The brownie tasted sugarless and flourless (not in a good way), but the ice cream (made in the restaurant) was decadent. Exactly what an American living in London missing peanut butter needed. \nI also recommend the Sicilian bottle of Shiraz. Very surprised at how smooth it was.\n\nThere is a reason this is not five stars - and it's because of my companion's meal. it really didn't measure up. The butternut squash soup to begin was good but the entree - vegetarian: Butternut Squash Risotto Log, Fennel Quiche & Warm Gorgonzola was a miss. It was as if three appetizers were put on one plate with nothing tying them together. And even individually, none were above average. She agreed though my choices were stand out.\n\nAll in all, this restaurant was very reasonably priced, attentive service, and great food. I'd go back in a second if in Edinburgh.

Focus is on local sourcing and showcasing the best of ingredients. Sample menu's on-line but subject to change as it is all about what is seasonal and available at the time.\n\nWent firstly for my birthday. Blythe R had been raving about it for ages and particularly had pointed out how amazing they were for gluten free so with that recommendation, it was on the to-do list. We were a party of seven and everyone kept saying how much they loved their dinner - like Carol W, I had the maple glazed duck, wild mushroom samosa (yep, gf!), grilled pak choi, sweet potato fondant and chartreuse sauce and it was all divine! I had also started with the Salmon so when it came to dessert, I passed to instead have tea. \n\nWell, I thought I wouldn't have dessert. Two of the girls ordered dessert and as we all tried and started making Meg Ryan sex noises (think sandwich shop in When Harry Met Sally) as it was THAT good, I ordered dessert and shared it round all the non dessert eaters. So - the dessert in question? A jaffa cake macaroon - completely gluten free - macaroon base, chocolate sorbet, orangey centre, cream and little chocolate dome to hide the orangey goodness then it is amazing, hence the 2nd visit.\n\nSecond visit was really for dessert but we figured we needed a main first and a gorgeous bottle of Yealand Sauv Blanc - as you do.

It was nice, but lacking in seasoning. I ordered the fish dish and when it came out, I realized it was the exact same dish as the scallops, just win a piece for bass instead of scallops. It was extremely under seasoned. It may have been my fault for not catching that the descriptions were similar, but I'm not sure why you'd have two so similar dishes on such a limited menu in the first place.

(What a genius, right?!) Field was one of them.\n\nWe actually had our dinner here back on (American) Thanksgiving Day, as there had been no turkeys to be found, but I had been so busy with school at the time that I never ended up leaving a review, and the guilt still plagues me--the meal was THAT good!!\n\n\nSo, my long overdue review:\nThe best way to put it is that the dinner we had here was absolutely grand. Of course, being two rather easy-going young adults, we had actually never been to such a high-class establishment before, so I'm sure we were both rather awkward, but the lovely man serving us made us feel so comfortable and cared for. We were extremely well taken care of, and THE FOOD!! The food was incredible. Every single bite had all these fantastic flavors and perfect, contrasted textures, and just wow. The dishes were all crafted from locally sourced ingredients (many of which we hadn't tasted before!), and it was all such a treat. To be honest, the plates looked small when they first came out, but we actually left incredibly satisfied and not at all hungry, despite having shared a starter before working through the two mains.\n\n(Also, the dishes were gorgeously presented--it almost made me feel guilty to dig in!)\n\nAlso, even though the place is definitely much fancier and more up-scale than what we are used to, its presentation as a whole is somehow kept very pleasantly comfortable and organic. The formal, sophisticated color scheme is brought down to earth--and even embellished!--by features like the lovely portrait of a handsome Dexter bull on the main wall. (Just check out their website--you'll get what I mean.)\n\nAll in all, Field was so incredibly wonderful that--even though it's completely out of our experience or comfort range--we have solid plans of returning! The price is a bit high, but so very worth it for a special night out. \n\nLovely staff, lovely little dining room, and SUCH lovely food! Thank you, Field, and thank you, most genius best friend!","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

A three course meal for £15.95. The first course was a fish fish (sorry forgot what the type of fish) on top of well season bed of grain. The crisps which were made from turnip have the dish an extra crunch. The fish was well seasoned and the flavour of the overall fish worked with the various combination of texture. I wanted more of the crisps! I could have eaten that all day! \n\nFor the main course I ordered a chicken dish.

After giving the menu a peruse online, I couldn't wait to try it.\n\nI really like the simplicty of the name: Field. From that, so much can be deduced. From Field to plate. As they say on their website, their aim is to showcase the best of local, Scottish produce and serve it in simple but beautiful ways. \n\nI went for lunch on a Lunch Quest with Blythe R, Katey L and Blythe's friend. Between the four of us we tried several different dishes. They have a fantastic deal on lunch: £11.50 for two courses. I, accidentally, didn't realise that it was only asterixed items on the menu, so didn't get this deal in the end. But if you follow it, it's fantastic value.\n\nI rarely start with soup, but the apple and celeriac soup sounded so good I had to have it. And in Blythe R's accompany (the Soup King of Edinburgh) I felt I should go the soup route. I'm so glad I did. With a walnut on top, I could taste both walnut and apple very strongly, but not overpoweringly, in the soup. And it had such a nice, light texture more like a velouté - well, half way between a foamy, airy velouté and a hearty soup. It was at once filling, and rich in flavour, but also delicate on the palate and light enough I could manage it all and (half) my main.\n\nMy grilled salmon fillet with potato croquettes and peppers? Divine. Absolutely divine. On my first mouthful I felt like I'd been transported to sitting on a mediteranean beach-front restaurant, eating freshly caught fish, grilled in the mediteranean fashion on a sun-soaked summer holiday. All of that feeling and memories from one mouthful. It was beautifully fresh fish, cooked perfectly with that nice grilled taste. My only regret was that there weren't more potato croquettes with it. Given that Blythe's hake came with a big stack of chunky chips, my salmon fillet had a modest 3 potato croquettes which were on the small side themselves. But I'm just being greedy.\n\nI didn't have dessert, but was sorely tempted by the baked pineapple with gingerbread. That is my sort of dessert. Fruity, but with some rich, gingery, cakey goodness. \n\nI have already decided to come back here, and am already torn between the maple-glazed duck as a main, or the hake which came with ratotouille (favourite) and whether to have a dessert or another starter. Hmmm.\n\nThe restaurant itself was perfect for a mid-week lunch. A sunny day, the room small room as lit up with outside light. The music was perfect (background jazz-type music). I've been in several fine dining restaurants recently where the music was odd and set a strange vibe. So I did notice a very nice ambience created by the soundtrack. It was full at lunch time with laid back lunchers like us. \n\nI can't wait to go back, and do hope it stays popular yet not overly packed in a 'so hot right now' way. I can see Field going from strength to strength and can't wait to see what next season will bring on the menu.","useful":8,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Field's mission statement is to take the concepts of Michelin dining and turn it into a relaxed affair and that's a breath of fresh air indeed.\n\nOpening in January of this year, the restaurant is run by an ambitious team who have taken their experiences from several notable establishments and put their own spin on fine dining.\n\nChef Gordon Craig for example, has worked at the Roux family's Waterside Inn, the Michelin starred Peat Inn and the Plumed Horse, while Maître D' Richard Conway worked at the later as restaurant manager.\n\nMy partner Sarah couldn't manage to this one, so I invited my brother Chris instead and he kindly added some professional photography skills to my humble blog. \n\nRichard greeted us warmly when we arrived  and we admired the freshness and feel of the dining area as the sunshine beamed through the windows. \n\nInstantly relaxed, you could tell there was going to be no pretention about Field and the giant cow picture brought both a talking point and a statement about the ethos of the restaurant.\n\nOur menus came playfully in a luminous green picture frames and offered an intriguing mix of seasonal dishes.  \n\nAs we awaited our order, we tucked into some delicious homemade sun dried tomato bread.  Always pleasing to see bread being made in house.\n\nChris opted for the asparagus, poached egg, parmesan crisp and pickled shimeji (£5.95), while I went for beetroot cured Scottish salmon, citrus crème fraiche, raisin and caper compote, pickled peppers and crispy crab ball (£5.25).\n\nMy starter was the perfect choice for a summery day: fresh, clean, light and zingy, it utilised the colours on the plate well and showed off some good quality ingredients.\n\nThe salmon was wonderfully tender and paired well with the bite of the pickled peppers. The citrus of the crème fraiche and flavours of the compote really excited the palette. The crab ball was crisp and had a pleasant note of dill through it, which I really liked.\n\nChris's asparagus came nicely chargrilled and still had suitable bite to it.  He burst the egg yolk to release a rich and velvety liquid centre that complimented the asparagus. The pickled mushroom gave a good contrast to the plate too, while the sauce brought it together. \n\nThis dish was simple yet effective and the chef really allows the ingredients to do the talking.\n\nI'm a man who really enjoys a good burger and after a fellow blogger recommended Field's chorizo burger (£9.95)  earlier in the week, my mind was already made up on my main course.\n\nMoist and tasty, the burger didn't disappoint.  It was a tad pink in places, which would probably put a few people off but I like my meat that way and gladly polished it off.  The sweet potato chips were very earthy and without a hint of grease on them.   \n\nHowever, the spicy mayo could have done with a bit more oomph for me.\n\nEnjoying his first Phil's Food World outing, Chris went for the pan friend hake with creamed sweetcorn, avocado, chorizo and chunky chips (£11.95). \n\nThe hake was very fresh and the flesh inside soft and flaky but we felt the skin could have been crisper.  Chris enjoyed the creamed sweetcorn in particular, as it partnered the fish superbly and was well seasoned and vibrant.   \n\nYou could tell the perfectly uniform manner in which the chorizo and avocado had been cut that this is a chef that cares what comes out of his kitchen.\n\nChris's generous portion of chips was equally as good as mine, which shows a good level of consistency and they dipped nicely into the creamed corn too!\n\nSo, to the third and final course and I went for coconut panna cotta with roasted pineapple and creamed gingerbread (£4.95) with Chris selecting peach tart tatin with Birds custard ice cream (£5.50).\n\nThe panna cotta was just set and no more and tasted pleasant.  The coconut on the outside added texture and enhanced the coconut taste of the mild set cream.\n\nThe pineapple in this Caribbean inspired dish worked with the coconut but could have been roasted a little more to add another dimension of flavour.  Unfortunately, I didn't really get anything from the gingerbread cream element.\n\nChris ordered peach tart tatin with Birds custard ice cream and was impressed with the way the home-made ice cream balanced out the sharpness of syrup. The tart itself was very tasty and the pastry was expertly cooked. The ice cream was certainly a notable highlight of this pudding.\n\nField has only been open around six months and is certainly one to watch. The team's philosophies and menus are excellent and extremely good value for money. It'll be interesting to see the restaurant develop in the near future.\n\nI have to say it's certainly one of the friendliest and most relaxing restaurants I've visited in a while.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

There was nothing, nothing, nothing not to love about it, except that it was over when I had eaten it all. That made me sad.\n\nBut not for long, because steering towards me at a goodly rate of knots was a glee dream of a sea bream.

Crispy skin, melt-in-the-mouth flesh, and the peas with bacon were an incredibly rich and delicious addition.

Delicious food which is immaculately presented and a lovely, cosy atmosphere made this the perfect place to finish off my work trip to Edinburgh. \n\nI love the small menu here - just 4 options for starters and mains (as well as one special) means you know that they're only dishing up the best of the best dishes. I couldn't go past the beetroot cured salmon, avocado mayonnaise, beetroot, passion fruit \"cannelloni\" & crispy crab ball - that's at least 5 of my favourite foods, all magically combined in one dish. And for the crazy price of £5.95 for a starter. The dish was bright, colourful, delicate, and everything was drawn together by the delicious avocado mayonnaise. Absolute heaven on a plate. \n\nFor mains I went for the smoked duck breast with celeriac remoulade, celeriac chips & spiced apple. I cheekily asked if I could have a side of the avocado that goes with the pork belly - baked avocado with sweet corn & chorizo gratin which wasn't a problem and I was delighted that I got this addiction as it was so sweet and creamy, the salty chorizo and pops of corn meant I wolfed this down pretty quickly. The duck was excellent with crispy skin and nice and juicy inside.

If you go by in the morning you can watch the staff preparing everything fresh, i quite like popping in for a fresh smoothie or coffee on my way to work, normally means i spend the next 3hrs thinking about what im going to have for my lunch though! I like the feel of the place, it has a nice vibe and friendly engaging staff, its especially good to know that its actually an independant Edinburgh owned company, support the local i say! There is normally a queue at lunch but the staff are quick and it tends to go in fast, the wait gives you time to decide what combination you are going to try! or whether your willpower will wain in front o the cake tray! The prices are competitive and definately value for money when you think of the quality your getting, you just have to look at the fresh rolls to know they are selling something quality goods. My recommendation...the sunflower seed roll toasted with cheese, chutney, pinenuts, spinach and roast peppers or maybe the....! cant decide!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The wraps are soft but not soggy. The fillings - oh  my the fillings. What everyone else before me has said is true. They're just exceptional, really something a bit different.\n\nThe crayfish and rocket was divine. I now want it for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow and maybe elevenses on Sunday. That good. The Thyme House was also mmmm tasty (although a little too rich on the mayo for me to have every day probably). Chicken, avocado, lettuce, what else was even there - I don't want to question it, best to leave it in a fuzzy haze of loving food memories.\n\nThyme are definitely a cut above the rest when it comes to sandwiches, rolls, wraps, salads and platters. Why would you pip for a pre-packaged generic tuna and sweetcorn when you could have something inspired, that will make your tastebuds do merry little dances of joy, for much the same price. And it's frickin' central too!\n\nIf you do something this weekend, try a Thyme wrap.

I know we're only 0.1 out of the recession people but please, I don't appreciate being ripped off. \nOver-charging aside though, I can see why this little place is so popular. With a varied selection of sandwhiches, smoothies and snacks, and their efficient service, it's no wonder this place is frequented by the hoards of office workers who scurry away from their desks every lunchtime.

You could spend 100 quid in a restaurant and not taste anything half as good. It really was tremendous, and if I remember correctly less than £3.\n\nThe slice of rocky road afterwards looked and tasted delightfully homemade, and I've no doubt that Thyme will be a regular lunchtime stopoff for me in days to come.

Last year (like this year) I escaped the Burgh at Festival time but had missed going to the champagne bar so this year, I was determined not to miss out and had my table booked a month in advance. \n\nThe Pommery Cafe Bar, hosted in conjunction with the Signet Library is a month long (Festival) pop-up bar offering champagne. This year, the menu was extended beyond afternoon teas to seafood platters and lobster and wedges. The Signet Library as Jenny L. mentioned, offered various vouchers for money off certain deals and these were valid throughout the month. For a budget visit, there were also offers on such as Twitter Tuesdays (15% off for tweeting pics\/tweets about the Pommery) and Wedges Wednesday (Wedges and Glass of Champagne for £10).\n\nLobster and wedges were £20 (normally £30 without the voucher) and they were fab. The lobster, although not the Boston portions I had reported on recently, were still decent portions and tasted fresh and delicious. The wedges are a small portion (still tasty with proper garlicky alioli) so don't come ready to eat your arm off. \nWe had a seafood platter as a starter and it was decent enough to feed three of us with drink munchies. Prawns, smoked salmon, beetroot salmon, trout, mackerel pate, bread and salad were all lovely and certainly were a good sign of things to come (sadly, I didn't take a picture). \n\nChampagne is available by the glass, bottle or magnum. I think the magnum is around £110, a bottle is average £52 and a glass around £11. We opted for a bottle (can't not drink champagne in a champagne bar) and it was lovely (an autumn blend).\n\nWe all thought the Cafe Bar was lovely and 'done' very well, with friendly staff but great service. Given demand at the Festival time, we weren't all squashed in and there was lots of room between tables. The setting was just stunning with the blue decor and given that I 'read' for a living, then I loved being surrounded by books. A great chance to see somewhere that is not normally open to the general public. \n\nNote: I'm also Gluten Free but everything (lobster, wedges and seafood minus bread) was ok for me to eat :)","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Nice clean atmosphere to hang out and enjoy a coffee or smoothie!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I needed a place to sit for twenty minutes and check my email, and knowing it would be rude to hang out in a cafe without buying anything, I got a simple cappuccino. When my waiter brought it right to my table and included a yummy foil-wrapped chocolate, I was happily surprised. Soon realizing I was also hungry, I decided to stay a while and have a bowl of soup. It was 3 pounds and change I believe, not too bad, I figured.\n\nThe lentil soup I ordered was so delicious, I told my waiter I'd never had anything like it and ordered another bowl. The cafe owner brought out my second bowl and explained that it was a recipe he'd brought from Turkey, which he makes in his home every morning to serve at the cafe. He said he was thrilled to hear I liked it, and wore a genuine beam of a smile.\n\nThough I've not tried any other menu items, the diners around me expressed pleasure with their meals.\n\nIn conclusion: the food and drinks are great, the service is great, the prices are about average and certainly worth paying for a quality experience.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Between them they have 5 full time artists and two apprentices. The standard of tattooing is genuinely world class, and the owner Morag regularly goes abroad to work at well respected tattoo conventions. Consultations are free and the attitude is always friendly and relaxed - no death metal and big smelly guys with beards here (well not most of the time). They also have tattoo removal , and cover-ups and repairs are a specialty.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Been the same guy that's done them all but with this joint you'll often be sharing the tattooing room with other customers, so if the sound of a loud tattoo needle gives you the chills you might need to book some private time.\n\nIt's roomier than Tribe 1 on Nicholson Street but the staff and artists seem to rotate between both of them. Keep your eyes peeled for the front door though as it easy to miss at the bottom of a flight of stairs off the bottom of Broughton Street. One of my tattoos was quoted at a higher price than I was eventually charged too, so they are fair in that regard.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}
